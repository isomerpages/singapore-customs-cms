# What are Trade Samples?

**Trade samples**  refer to goods which are imported solely:

-   For the purpose of being shown or demonstrated in Singapore to enable manufacturers in Singapore to produce these goods to fulfill orders from abroad or to solicit orders for goods to be supplied from abroad; or
-   By a manufacturer for the purposes of copying, testing or experimenting before producing these goods in Singapore

Trade samples must also not be sold, consumed, put to normal use, or used in any way for hire or reward while in Singapore.

## Procedures for Importing Trade Samples

Importers of trade samples are required to pay the  [Goods and Services Tax (GST)](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/goods-and-services-tax-gst) and/or  [duty](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-and-fees/duties-and-dutiable-goods).

GST is calculated based on the  [Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) value](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports) of the goods, together with all duties payable. The importer has to obtain the commercial value from the supplier if the value of the trade samples is not stated in the commercial invoice.

The commercial value should be based on the transaction value of identical or similar goods from the same country of origin that is exported at about the same time.

The commercial invoice may indicate Value for Customs Purposes Only, which means that there is no sale of goods involved. However, the importer should provide the supporting trade documents to substantiate the commercial value of the imported trade samples.

Please retain the relevant import permit (please refer to next section for permit requirements) and supporting documents (commercial invoice, packing list, Bill of Lading/Airway Bill, etc.) of the trade samples. At the time of cargo clearance, the import permit and supporting documents must be produced to the checking officer for verification.

## Controlled and Non-Controlled Trade Samples

You are advised to check if your trade sample is a controlled item before importing it.  Please click  [here](/businesses/importing-goods/controlled-and-prohibited-goods-for-import) for more information on controlled and prohibited goods, and how to check if your samples are subject to control.
