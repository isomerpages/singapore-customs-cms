# Importing of Pets for Commercial Purpose

The importation of goods, including pets, incurs Goods and Services Tax (GST). The GST for the importation of pets for commercial purposes is calculated based on the  [Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) value](/businesses/importing-goods/importing-dutiable-motor-vehicles/establishing-the-customs-value) of the goods.

The National Parks Board (NParks)  [Animal and Veterinary Service](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/avs){:target="_blank"} (AVS) regulates all importation of live pets. Importers should abide by NParks'  [import licence and quarantine requirements](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/avs/pets/bringing-animals-into-singapore-and-exporting/bringing-in-and-transshipping-dogs-and-cats/general-information){:target="_blank"}.
