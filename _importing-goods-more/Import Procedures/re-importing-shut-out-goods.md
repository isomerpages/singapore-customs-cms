# Re-importing Shut-out Goods

Shut-out goods refer to goods which are not carried on the intended vessel or aircraft.

Shut-out goods that were originally intended to be exported and sent to Free Trade Zones (FTZs), authorised piers and places may be re-imported into a licensed warehouse (for dutiable goods) or Zero GST warehouse (for non-dutiable goods) due to the following reasons:

-   Change of departure date or time;
-   Change of transportation mode (for example, from air to sea);
-   Cancellation of shipment; and
-   Non-fulfillment of goods’ quantity or specifications.

Goods and Services Tax (GST) relief may be granted for such cases of re-import and duty suspension. Please refer to  [Circular No. 07/2016](/news-and-media/circulars/2016-04-26-Circular072016.pdf) for more information regarding the documentation requirements to remove shut-out goods from FTZ.
