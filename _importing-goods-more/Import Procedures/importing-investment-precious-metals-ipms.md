# Importing Investment Precious Metals (IPMs)

The import of investment precious metals (IPMs) into Singapore for commercial or personal use is exempted from Goods and Services Tax (GST).

You should first be familiar with the qualifying criteria of IPMs and  **conduct a self-assessment**  before the actual import.
