# Permit Amendment

You may amend an approved permit via TradeNet if it is within the permit's validity period. There is no limit to the number of times a permit can be amended. Do note that not all fields are amendable. Please click  [here](https://www.customs.gov.sg/files/businesses/PSB/TN%20Team/annex-b-fields-not-allowed-for-amendment.pdf)  for the list of non-amendable fields.

You are not allowed to amend an import permit if:
-   It has been used for cargo clearance;
-   It has expired;
-   The fields are non-amendable. Please click <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/files/businesses/PSB/TN%20Team/annex-b-fields-not-allowed-for-amendment.pdf">here</a> for the list of non-amendable fields.

You may extend the validity period of the payment permit after payment is received and before it expires.
- For payment permits approved under the GF (payment by importer’s Inter-Bank Giro (IBG)) or G7 (payment by Declaring Agent’s IBG) condition, payment will be received 5 working days after the permit approval date. 
- For payment permits approved under the G1 (payment by cash or cheque at any UOB branch) condition, payment will be received 5 working days after the cheque/ cash has been deposited at the UOB bank. 

Once the amendments have been made, the most updated approved copy of the permit must be produced to the checkpoint officers for verification at the time of cargo clearance, if required in the permit conditions. Please refer to the  [sample of an amended Cargo Clearance Permit](/files/businesses/PSB/TN%20Team/sample-CCP-Amendment.pdf).

# Permit Cancellation

Please cancel the permit within the permit validity period and apply for a new one if you have provided inaccurate details which cannot be amended. You are not allowed to use import permits that have been cancelled to import goods.

Payment permits approved under the GF (payment by importer's IBG) or G7 (payment by Declaring Agent's IBG) condition must be cancelled before 2359 hours for the cancellation to be processed on the same day. Otherwise, cancellations for payment permits approved under the GF or G7 condition (as well as G1 condition i.e. payment by cash or cheque at any UOB branch) that are submitted within the permit validity period will require 5 working days for processing due to the time needed to verify the GIRO deduction.

You may have to cancel certain permits  (e.g. In-Non-Payment-Approved Premises/Schemes permits)or extend their validity period if you do not use them . Please refer to the requirements stated in the permit conditions.

You are not allowed to cancel an import permit if:

-   It has been used for cargo clearance;
-   It has expired for more than a calendar day;
-   It is an In-Payment permit with duty or tax amount being paid; or
-   It has been requested by the Manifest Compliance Unit of Singapore Customs for audit purposes.

For such cases, you are requested to submit a  [voluntary disclosure](/businesses/compliance/voluntary-disclosure-programme)  to Singapore Customs.
