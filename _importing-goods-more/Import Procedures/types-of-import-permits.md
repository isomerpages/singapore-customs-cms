## TradeNet Unavailability

In the event of an unscheduled TradeNet unavailability announced by Singapore Customs, importers who are unable to obtain an approved Customs permit may be advised by Singapore Customs to use a [Letter of Undertaking](/files/businesses/lou-template-for-tn-unavailability-6aug15-(1).docx) to facilitate the clearance of their goods. This will be announced via a Customs Notice.

The importer should obtain a customs permit for the goods within **three** **days** from the date TradeNet is restored. However, importers are still required to make duty and/or GST payment at the checkpoints, if there is no [duty-free concession](/individuals/going-through-customs/arrivals/duty-free-concession-and-gst-relief) on the goods imported.
