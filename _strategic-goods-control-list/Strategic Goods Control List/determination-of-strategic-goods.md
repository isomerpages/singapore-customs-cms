# Determination of Strategic Goods

## How to determine strategic goods?

To determine if your product is controlled under the Strategic Goods (Control) Act (SGCA), please compare your product’s description and specification against the descriptions in the  [Strategic Goods Control List](/businesses/strategic-goods-control/strategic-goods-control-list){:target="_blank"}. If your product meets the stated descriptions, it is controlled as strategic goods under the SGCA. You may refer to this  [guidebook](/files/businesses/Guidebook On Determination Of Strategic Goods_Oct21.pdf){:target="_blank"} for more information.

## Determination Database

The  [Determination Database](/files/businesses/Strategic-Goods-Determination-Database_Sep-19.xlsx)  is a list of products and their determination compiled from past applications. You may refer to it to view products which have been assessed by Singapore Customs.

_Disclaimer:_ _The determination of strategic goods provided here is for general reference only. Every effort has been made to ensure that the information presented is complete and accurate._ _Singapore Customs assumes no responsibility and accepts no liability for any action taken or omitted by you on the basis of the classification provided._

## What if I am unable to determine if my product is controlled as strategic goods?

If you are unable to determine whether your product is controlled as strategic goods after going through the Strategic Goods Control List and Determination Database, you may submit an  [Application for Determination of Strategic Goods](https://form.gov.sg/5d78b89628467500121ef098){:target="_blank"} to Singapore Customs for advice on the product determination.

Please note it is not necessary to submit this application if you are able to classify your products. It is a quicker option for you to carry out your own determination.

## What do I need to take note for my application?

Each application is for the classification of  **ONE**  product only. Please fill in all fields and indicate “NA” if the field is not applicable.

-   Describe in detail the intended end-use of your product (not the function of the product, which is described in another field)
-   Describe in detail the intended end-use of the next higher assembly if your product is a component of a system or used to make or repair another product
-   Indicate the part/component description and its corresponding Strategic Goods Product Code if you know that your product contains any parts/components that are controlled under the SGCA
-   Indicate if your product is specially designed for any specific equipment

To minimise any delay in processing your application, please provide the required information and ensure your application is completed properly and accompanied by all supporting documents.
