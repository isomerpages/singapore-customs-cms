# Customs Crest

![](/images/21Jan25_Small_Version_A.png)

Our crest symbolises our twin functions both as a collector of revenue and a facilitator of trade and travel.

It consists of the State Arms which surmounts the caduceus. This is the symbol of trade and commerce and the two keys pointing upwards and outwards project the department's aim to achieve higher levels of trade facilitation while ensuring revenue protection. A pair of golden fronds encloses and supports the State Arms, the caduceus and the keys.

Beneath the fronds lies a red banner bearing the inscription "SINGAPORE CUSTOMS".
