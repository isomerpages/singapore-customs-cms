A Claimant registration is required before a Claimant Organisation can be granted the Goods and Services Tax (GST) relief and/or duty exemption for the following scenarios only:

A Claimant Organisation is an organisation or a person as specified in the second column of the Schedules under the [Customs (Duties) (Exemption) Order](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/CA1960-OR5#pr2-), [Goods and Services Tax (Imports Relief) Order](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/GSTA1993-OR3) and International Arrangements Relief Notification, that is exempted from the payment of duty or GST for the importation of goods specified in the third column of the said Schedules.

A Claimant is an individual from a Claimant Organisation who is responsible to receive the goods that are exempted from the payment of duty and/or GST on behalf of the entity and ensures that the goods granted duty exemption and/or GST relief are meant for an entity’s official use or an Entitled Individual’s personal use when they are applying for the duty exemption/GST relief permits.

When submitting the duty and/or GST exemption permit applications, the Declaring Agents are required to declare the registered Claimant’s UEN, organisation, name and code in the relevant fields.
