# Application Procedure

[Declaring Entities](/businesses/new-traders-and-registration-services/registration-services/activate-customs-account)  that wish to make payment of duties, taxes, fees, penalties and other charges on services offered by Singapore Customs from your bank account to Singapore Customs directly (instead of through their  [Declaring Agent](/businesses/new-traders-and-registration-services/registration-services/apply-update-renew-terminate-declaring-agent-account-and-declarant)), and all Declaring Agents must apply for an Inter-Bank GIRO (IBG) with Singapore Customs.

The bank account must be linked to your entity's Unique Entity Number and under one of the IBG participating banks listed in  [The Association of Banks in Singapore](https://abs.org.sg/docs/library/swift_bic_codes.pdf){:target="_blank"}'s website.

To apply,  **mail**  the completed [Application for Inter-Bank Giro form](/eservices/customs-forms-and-service-links) to Singapore Customs' address as indicated in the form.

The processing of the application usually takes three to four weeks.

When the IBG application is approved, the Primary Contact (or the Secondary Contact should transmission to Primary Contact fails) registered in your  [Customs Account](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/TN41EFORM/tds/sp/splogin.do?action=init_acct){:target="_blank"}
 will receive a fax or email notification.

If you have an existing IBG with Singapore Customs and wish to change the bank account used for your IBG, you are required to submit a new IBG application.

## Authorise a Declaring Agent

You may  [authorise your Declaring Agent](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/TN41EFORM/tdsui/authdeclaringagent/addanddelete.do?doAction=INITIALIZE&APPLICATION_ID=TXWP){:target="_blank"} to use your IBG for the payment of duties and GST for your customs permits.

Learn more about authorising Declaring Agents [here](/businesses/new-traders-and-registration-services/registration-services/authorise-a-declaring-agent).

When your customs permit application requiring duty and/or GST payment is approved, the payment mode will be denoted by the  [permit condition(s) for payment](/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/).

## Checking your IBG Deduction Status

Your entity's bank statement will reflect successful IBG deductions initiated by Singapore Customs. The format and type of information such as permit number reflected in the bank statement may differ for different banks.

You may consider  [registering](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/login.portal){:target="_blank"} as a TradeNet user to obtain your entity's past permit application details to reconcile with the bank statement.  

You also may sign up for the Trader Notification service to receive notifications on the permit details such as the approval date, Declaring Agent details, total amount of duty and/or GST payable for in-payment permits taken using your entity's UEN.

If the IBG deduction for a payment permit is unsuccessful, your entity's Primary Contact (or Secondary Contact if the Primary Contact does not have a valid contact) registered in your entity's Customs Account will be informed by Singapore Customs on the follow-up actions required for payment.

Please ensure that you maintain sufficient funds in your entity's bank account and update Singapore Customs on any changes to the bank account, as penalties or fees may be imposed for failed IBG deductions.


## Terminating your IBG Arrangement with Singapore Customs

Please contact your bank directly to terminate your IBG arrangement. Upon successful termination by your bank, please email your IBG termination to [customs_documentation@customs.gov.sg](mailto:customs_documentation@customs.gov.sg)

However, if you are a Declaring Agent, it is mandatory for you to maintain a valid IBG with Singapore Customs. If you intend to change your bank account used for IBG deduction, you are required to submit a new IBG application. Your existing IBG with Singapore Customs will be terminated when your new IBG application is approved.
