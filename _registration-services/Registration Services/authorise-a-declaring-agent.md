# Authorise a Declaring Agent (DA)

The day after the approval of your Inter-Bank GIRO (IBG) application or successful registration of your security with Singapore Customs, the Key Personnel of your entity whose particulars are registered with a Unique Entity Number (UEN) Issuance Agency such as Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, Registry of Societies etc. or the Authorised Personnel of the entity may  [authorise your DA](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/TN41EFORM/tdsui/authdeclaringagent/addanddelete.do?doAction=INITIALIZE&APPLICATION_ID=TXWP){:target="_blank"} to use your:

-   **IBG** for the payment of duties and Goods and Services Tax for your customs permit; and
-   **Security** for your permit applications.

You can authorise up to 20 DA.

You can also [add or remove any authorised DA](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/TN41EFORM/tdsui/authdeclaringagent/addanddelete.do?doAction=INITIALIZE&APPLICATION_ID=TXWP)
  whenever there are changes in your commercial arrangement with them, and when there are changes in you or your DA's UEN.

You need not re-authorise your DA when you change the bank account used for your IBG or when you renew your security with Singapore Customs. You may approach your entity's Primary Contact (or the Secondary Contact should transmission to Primary Contact fails) registered in your  [Customs Account](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/TN41EFORM/tds/sp/splogin.do?action=init_acct){:target="_blank"}
, to obtain the approval letter which contains the full list of DA(s) who are authorised to use your entity's IBG and/or security as of the letter date.

**Authorisation of Declaring Agent (DA) for Licensed Premises**


Declaring Agents (DAs) can only apply for permits involving movements of goods into, between and out of licensed premises after the licensed premises operator has authorised the DAs.

In order to authorise a DA, the licensed premises operator is required to complete and submit the [Application for the Authorisation of DAs for Licensed Premises](https://form.gov.sg/63c50316d4e11c0012da2b09) form. The application will take 2 working days to process.
