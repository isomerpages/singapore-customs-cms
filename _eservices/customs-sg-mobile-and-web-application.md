## About Customs@SG

The  **Customs@SG**  mobile app is a convenient way for travellers to declare and pay duty and/or Goods and Services Tax (GST) on their overseas purchases anytime, anywhere, before the travellers arrive in Singapore.

Travellers with purchases that have exceeded their personal  [duty free concession or GST relief](/individuals/going-through-customs/arrivals/duty-free-concession-and-gst-relief) can use  **Customs@SG**  to make an advance declaration and pay the duty and/or GST without having to visit the Customs Tax Payment Office at the checkpoint when they arrive in Singapore. Once payment has been made, the app will automatically create an e-receipt in the traveller’s mobile phone. Travellers can proceed to exit the checkpoint by the Customs Green Channel. When they are stopped for checks, travellers can show the e-receipts on their smartphone as proof of payment.

Travellers can also choose to declare and pay the taxes online through the  **Customs@SG**  web portal.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### **A. Customs@SG Mobile App/Web Application**

**1.** **What is this Customs@SG Mobile App about?**

Customs@SG is a mobile app developed by Singapore Customs to provide travellers and members of the public with a more convenient way to interact with us. The app has two modules: Goods to Declare module and Feedback module.  
  
The Goods to Declare module allows you to declare and pay, not more than 3 days before your arrival in Singapore, the duty and/or GST on the goods that you will be bringing into Singapore.   
  
The Feedback module allows you to provide feedback or submit queries on Customs matters to us.

If your declaration is made via the mobile app, you are not required to print the receipt as an e-receipt will be automatically created in your mobile app and saved under “My Receipts”.
