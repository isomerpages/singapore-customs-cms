<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
<h3><strong>A. Customs@SG Web Application</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1.</strong>  <strong>What is this Customs@SG Web Application about?</strong>
</p>
<p>Customs@SG is a web application developed by Singapore Customs to provide
travellers and members of the public with a more convenient way to interact
with us. The Customs@SG web application has two modules: Declare Goods
module and Search Receipts / Drafts module.</p>
<p>The Declare Goods module allows you to declare and pay, not more than
3 days before your arrival in Singapore, the duty and/or GST on the goods
that you will be bringing into Singapore.</p>
<p>The Search Receipts module allows you to retrieve your receipt by entering
the Declaration Number and your email address in the web application. The
Declaration Number will be emailed to you when you have made a declaration
or saved as a draft.</p>
<p>The Draft module allows you to retrieve your declaration draft. You can
retrieve your draft by entering the Declaration Number and your email address
in the web application to complete the declaration and payment process.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>  <strong>Can I declare and pay the taxes for all my overseas purchases which I am bringing back to Singapore in one declaration?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes you can. However, you must declare and pay the duty and/or GST for
all your overseas purchases in one declaration.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>  <strong>Must I print the receipt for inspection at the checkpoint?</strong>
</p>
<p>You can show the e-receipt downloaded on your mobile device or print it
out as proof of tax payment.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong>  <strong>Do I have to produce the goods together with the receipt to the inspection officer at the Customs Red channel?</strong>
</p>
<p>You are not required to declare your goods again at the Customs Red Channel
if you have declared and made the due duty and/or GST payment for your
goods via the Customs@SG web application. Please exit the checkpoint through
the Customs Green Channel. If you are stopped for checks, you may present
the receipt downloaded on your mobile device or the printed hardcopy receipt
to the checking officer as proof of tax payment.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong>  <strong>I intend to buy 4 litres of liquors from Singapore's Duty Free Shop. As I have exceeded my duty-free allowance, can I use the Customs@SG web application to make duty and GST payment for the additional 2 litres of liquors?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, you can. However, some duty-free shops do not allow the sale of liquors
in excess of duty-free allowance. Please approach the Duty Free Shop directly
if you wish to purchase liquors exceeding your duty-free allowance.</p>
<p>Please also ensure that you have made the declaration and tax payment
for the liquors exceeding your duty-free allowance using the Customs@SG
web application before exiting via the Customs Green Channel.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong>  <strong>Can I use the Customs@SG web application to make payment for controlled goods under the purview of other authorities (e.g. medicinal products, pets)?</strong>
</p>
<p>No. The importation of controlled goods into Singapore is regulated by
the relevant Competent Authorities (CAs). CAs may require you to obtain
a licence, import permit or authorisation form prior to the importation
of controlled goods into Singapore. Upon your arrival, please present the
controlled goods and the accompanying import permit or authorisation form
to the checking officer at the Customs Red Channel.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong>  <strong>The Customs@SG web application prompted me to take up a TradeNet permit for my goods. Why is a permit required? How should I go about doing it?</strong>

goods:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>More than 0.4 kilogrammes of cigarettes or tobacco products;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than 10 litres of liquor products; and</p>
</li>
<li>

GST incurred exceeds S$300.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please appoint a <a href="/businesses/business-resources/directories-of-service-providers/list-of-local-forwarding-agents" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">local freight forwarding agent</a> to
help you declare a TradeNet permit for your goods.</p>

<p>Please approach our officers at the Customs Tax Payment Office with your
goods for assistance.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong>  <strong>I will be arriving in Singapore later than the date of arrival declared in the Customs@SG web application as my flight was delayed. Is my e-receipt with the details of my duty and GST payment valid as proof of tax payment?</strong>
</p>

If the date you arrived in Singapore is different from the date of arrival

</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp; Your trip to Singapore has been cancelled; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp; The declared quantity exceeds the physical quantity in your possession.

</p>
<p>With effect from 1 July 2020, all cigarettes and other tobacco products
imported into, sold, offered for sale or distributed in Singapore must
comply with the new SP requirements. Travellers have to ensure that their
cigarettes and/or tobacco products comply with the SP requirements before

<p>Importation of cigarettes and/or tobacco products that do not comply with
the SP requirements is not allowed, and these cigarettes and/or tobacco
products will be disposed of at the checkpoints. For further information,

<p><strong>13.</strong>  <strong>I am importing my personal pet to Singapore. Can I pay GST using Customs@SG web application?</strong>

and payment of GST for the importation of pets. For more information on
