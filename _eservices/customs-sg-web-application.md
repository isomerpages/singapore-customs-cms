## About Customs@SG

The  [**Customs@SG**  web application](https://m.customs.gov.sg/CustomsTravellerPortal) is a convenient way for travellers to declare and pay duty and/or Goods and Services Tax (GST) on their overseas purchases anytime, anywhere, before the travellers arrive in Singapore.

Travellers with purchases that have exceeded their personal  [duty free concession or GST relief](/individuals/going-through-customs/arrivals/duty-free-concession-and-gst-relief) can use  **Customs@SG** web application to make an advance declaration and pay the duty and/or GST without having to visit the Customs Tax Payment Office at the checkpoint when they arrive in Singapore. Once payment has been made, travellers will be notified via email, and travellers have the option of downloading the receipt from the web application. Travellers can proceed to exit the checkpoint by the Customs Green Channel. When they are stopped for checks, travellers can show the e-receipts on their mobile device or printed hardcopy receipts as proof of payment.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### **A. Customs@SG Web Application**

**1.** **What is this Customs@SG Web Application about?**

Customs@SG is a web application developed by Singapore Customs to provide travellers and members of the public with a more convenient way to interact with us. The Customs@SG web application has two modules: Declare Goods module and Search Receipts / Drafts module.  
  
The Declare Goods module allows you to declare and pay, not more than 3 days before your arrival in Singapore, the duty and/or GST on the goods that you will be bringing into Singapore.

The Search Receipts module allows you to retrieve your receipt by entering the Declaration Number and your email address in the web application. The Declaration Number will be emailed to you when you have made a declaration or saved as a draft.

The Draft module allows you to retrieve your declaration draft. You can retrieve your draft by entering the Declaration Number and your email address in the web application to complete the declaration and payment process.

You are not required to declare your goods again at the Customs Red Channel if you have declared and made the due duty and/or GST payment for your goods via the Customs@SG web application.

Upon your arrival, please present the controlled goods and the accompanying import permit or authorisation form to the checking officer at the Customs Red Channel.
