## How to be a TradeNet user?

## What you need to know when submitting applications via TradeNet

**1) Unique Reference Number**

Each application submitted via TradeNet has a Unique Reference Number (URN) which is made up of 3 data elements: declarant entity identifier, date of creation and the sequence number.

Before the application is approved, you are required to quote the URN in all subsequent references to the application. If supporting documents are required by the relevant Competent Authorities (CAs), please quote the URN in all the documents in your submission. The CAs will also reference the URN in their replies to your application.

**2) Check Status of Application**

You may check on the status of your application by:

-   Activating your TradeNet front-end solution to receive the status, or
-   Enquiring via the TradeNet back-end user interface

The status of your application may be one of the following:

-   Approved with a permit number
-   Pending processing by Singapore Customs or the relevant CA
-   Rejected with the following error codes:

|Code|Definition  |
|--|--|
|  DCS ERROR| Rejected by TradeNet due to syntax errors |
| CA/SC REJECT | Rejected by CA or Singapore Customs |

If it is rejected, you will need to meet the requirements or make the necessary amendments before re-submitting the application.
