# Competent Authorities' Requirements for Controlled Items

All imports, exports and transhipments must be covered by the relevant permits.

If the goods are subject to control by the relevant Competent Authority (CA), you are required to comply with the respective CA’s requirement when preparing and completing a permit application for submission via TradeNet.

Before you put up a permit application for controlled items, please note these 3 steps:

**Step 1**: Identify the Harmonised System (HS) code of the item and its corresponding CA(s).

You may refer to the link below for the HS Codes of controlled items under the various CAs’ control, and the contact information of the CA(s):

-   [HS CA Product Code Search](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/portlets/search/searchHSCA/searchInitHSCA.do){:target="\_blank"}

Examples:

|   | HS Code  |  Description of goods |  Import |  Export|  Transhipment
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Example 1: SFA (Processed Food) controls the import of the item  |  19059030 |  Cakes| PFO | -| -|
| Example 2: NParks (CITES) controls the import, export and transhipment of the item  | 12112090  |  Ginseng roots chilled or frozen | CIT | CIT | CIT ||||
| Example 3: SFA (Processed Food) and Health Sciences Authority (Health Products Regulation Group) controls the import of the item  | 21069072 | Other food supplements excluding those based on ginseng  |PFO, HPR| -| -| -|
| Example 4: Non-controlled item | 42021110 | Suitcase or briefcase with outer surface of leather or of composition leather with maximum dimensions of 56cm x 45cm x 25cm   | - | - | - |
    
    

**Step 2**: Determine whether the item is controlled by more than one CA (refer to the lists of “All HS/CA Product Code” and “All Product Code Pair” downloadable from the [HS CA Product Code Search](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/portlets/search/searchHSCA/searchInitHSCA.do)) and the product code(s) to be declared. Please note that for paired product codes, both CAs’ product codes must be declared in the permit application.

**Step 3**: Comply with the specific [CA's requirements](https://www.customs.gov.sg/files/businesses/psb/tn%20team/annex-d-competent-authorities-requirements.pdf) to avoid delays in processing, and obtain approval from the CA. Please remember to upload the relevant supporting documents required by the CAs in your TradeNet permit application.
