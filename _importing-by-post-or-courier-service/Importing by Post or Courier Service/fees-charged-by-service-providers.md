# Fees Charged by Service Providers

Please be informed that the charges involved in the handling of your importation of goods may vary among different service providers. Such charges may exceed the cost of your online purchase and may include shipping fees, handling fees, clearance fees, permit application fees as well as any GST and/or duty payment made by the service provider on your behalf.

You are strongly advised to check with the e-commerce platform provider and their service providers on all charges that may be incurred when you import your shipment before making any purchases and engaging their services. You should request for a breakdown of the fees.
