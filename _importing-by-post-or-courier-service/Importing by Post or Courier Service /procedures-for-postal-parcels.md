## Controlled Goods (applicable to both Dutiable and non-Dutiable Goods)

-   If a postal parcel contains controlled goods, the postal parcel will be detained by ICA and subject to assessment by the relevant Competent Authority(s) (“CA”). 
-   The importer will be informed through an email from SingPost to apply for the necessary authorisation online from the relevant CA. 
-   Certain CAs may require the importer to take up a customs permit to account for the importation of the controlled goods. In such cases, the CA will notify the importer and the importer should apply for a customs permit accordingly.
-   Once the customs permit is taken (if required) and relevant CA authorisation is obtained, the postal parcel would be cleared by ICA and SingPost would deliver the postal parcel to the importer’s address.

## Goods Delivered to Companies Operating within Free Trade Zones

-   GST is levied on all goods which are imported into Singapore for local consumption. This includes goods that are consumed within the Free Trade Zones (FTZ).

-   Where a postal item (parcel and mail) indicates an address within the FTZ on the CN 22 / CN 23 for delivery, the postal item shall be presumed to be intended for consumption within the FTZ, In such cases, the postal item would be taxable unless its value is below S$400.

-   Where the postal item is intended to be re-exported, the recipient is required to produce to SingPost a TradeNet permit to prove the recipient's intent to re-export or store the goods within the FTZ (pending re-export). Such permits and all other relevant documentation must be kept as supporting documents and produced to Customs upon request.
