## Goods Delivered to Companies Operating within Free Trade Zones

-   GST is levied on all goods which are imported into Singapore for local consumption. This includes goods that are consumed within the Free Trade Zones (FTZ).

-   Where a postal item (parcel and mail) indicates an address within the FTZ on the CN 22 / CN 23 for delivery, the postal item shall be presumed to be intended for consumption within the FTZ, In such cases, the postal item would be taxable unless its value is below S$400.

-   Where the postal item is intended to be re-exported, the recipient is required to produce to SingPost a TradeNet permit to prove the recipient's intent to re-export or store the goods within the FTZ (pending re-export). Such permits and all other relevant documentation must be kept as supporting documents and produced to Customs upon request.
