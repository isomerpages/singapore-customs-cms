# International Fora

Singapore Customs participates actively in international and regional customs fora to work with other Customs administrations to facilitate international trade. The key fora that Singapore Customs attend are:

**World Customs Organisation (WCO)**

The [World Customs Organisation](http://www.wcoomd.org/en.aspx){:target="_blank"} (WCO) is an independent intergovernmental body whose mission is to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of customs administrations. Singapore became a member of the WCO in 1975.

Singapore Customs adopts WCO’s instruments and tools such as the SAFE Framework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade, Harmonised System (HS) Classification of Goods and WCO Data Model.

**Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Sub-Committee on Customs Procedures (SCCP)**

The [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation](http://www.apec.org/){:target="_blank"} (APEC) was established in 1989 in response to the growing interdependence among Asia-Pacific economies.

Singapore Customs participates in the SCCP. The main objectives of the SCCP are to simplify and harmonise regional customs procedures to ensure that goods and services move efficiently, effectively and safely through the region, and to facilitate border control.

**Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Community**

The [Association of Southeast Asian Nations](http://www.asean.org/){:target="_blank"} (ASEAN) was established on 8 August 1967. Several instruments have been concluded over the years to further the cooperation among ASEAN customs administrations.

**Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Working Group on Customs Matters (AWC) and ASEM Customs Director-Generals/Commissioners Meeting**

The [Asia-Europe Meeting](http://www.aseminfoboard.org/){:target="_blank"} (ASEM) is an informal process of dialogue and cooperation bringing together European and Asian countries. The first ASEM Summit was held in 1996. Singapore Customs participates in the ASEM Working Group on Customs Matters (AWC) and ASEM Customs Director-Generals/Commissioners Meeting.

# Our International Contributions

**ASEAN Customs Procedures and Trade Facilitation Working Group (CPTFWG)**<br>
Singapore Customs currently chairs the Customs Procedures and Trade Facilitation Working Group (CPTFWG), which is established to implement the Strategic Plans of Customs Development (SPCDs) at both the regional and national level. The CPTFWG also aims to enhance partnership with businesses and economic operators to secure the international supply chain and create a business-friendly environment for legitimate trade to flow. 

**Sub-Working Group on ASEAN Customs Transit System (SWG-ACTS)**<br>
Singapore Customs participates in the Sub-Working Group on ASEAN Customs Transit System (SWG-ACTS), which works on the implementation of the ACTS. Guided by the ASEAN Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of Goods in Transit (AFAFGIT) and its protocols, the ACTS is a computerised Customs transit management system, owned by ASEAN, to facilitate goods movement through ASEAN under a single transit regime. The ACTS allows each ASEAN Member State (AMS) to capture and track the status and movement of the goods.

Additional information on the ACTS can be found at [https://acts.asean.org](https://acts.asean.org){:target="_blank"}

**Sub-Working Group on ASEAN Authorised Economic Operator Mutual Recognition Arrangement (SWG-AAMRA)**<br>
Singapore Customs currently chairs the Sub-working Group on ASEAN Authorised Economic Operator Mutual Recognition Arrangement (SWG-AAMRA). The SWG-AAMRA works on a pathfinder approach to implement an ASEAN Authorised Economic Operator – Mutual Recognition Arrangement (AEO-MRA)  with AMS ASEAN member states who have implemented their national AEO programmes. In line with the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) Blueprint 2025 to achieve a highly integrated and cohesive ASEAN economy, a regional ASEAN AEO-MRA could potentially enhance trade and promote economic growth in ASEAN by reducing regulatory burden on international trade and facilitating the movement of goods within ASEAN. 

**ASEAN Single Window Steering Committee (ASWSC)**<br>
Singapore Customs currently chairs the ASEAN Single Window Steering Committee (ASWSC), which manages the development of the ASEAN Single Window (ASW). The ASW is a regional initiative that connects and integrates National Single Windows (NSW) of AMS. The ASW’s objective is to expedite cargo clearance and promote ASEAN economic integration by enabling the electronic exchange of border trade-related documents among AMS. 

Additional information on the ASW can be found at [https://asw.asean.org](https://asw.asean.org){:target="_blank"}    

**ASEAN Customs Capacity Building Working Group (CCBWG)**

*Knowledge- Based Service (KBS)*<br>
To support ASEAN community-building efforts, Singapore Customs participates in the ASEAN Customs Capacity Building Working Group (CCBWG), which aims to promote best practices to improve technical and professional capabilities of Customs Personnel. A [Knowledge-Based Service (KBS) website](http://kbscustoms.asean.org/){:target="_blank"} was developed by Thai Customs to enhance awareness of CCBWG’s work and promote knowledge-sharing amongst ASEAN Customs administrations.
