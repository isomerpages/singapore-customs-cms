<h5><strong>Join our purpose-driven organisation now and make a difference in our nation-building efforts as</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Trade Facilitator</p>
<p>We facilitate customs connectivity across borders for a seamless and resilient
end-to-end international supply chain and work closely with local and international
partners to advance Singapore’s economy. For example, through Free Trade
Agreements (FTAs), we work with our FTA partners to reduce trade barriers,
enable faster and efficient clearance of goods, and provide for preferential
tariff treatment for Singapore origin goods. Through Digital Economy Agreements
(DEAs) and other bilateral agreements, we connect digitally to other Customs
administrations to exchange data and digital documents, providing time
and cost savings to companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trade Regulator</p>
<p>We uphold the rules of trade and tariffs and keep a close watch on strategic
goods and technologies to maintain an effective and robust regulatory regime.
In doing so, we contribute to international efforts to prevent the proliferation
of arms, missiles and weapons of mass destruction and safeguard Singapore’s
reputation as a global trade hub trusted by foreign trading partners and
businesses. We maintain a robust duty and tax collection regime, that contributes
about close to 15% of total government annual tax revenue, hence contributing
to nation building.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Law Enforcer</p>
<p>Adopting a whole-of-government approach, we protect Singapore’s revenue
and level the playing field for law-abiding businesses by working closely
with other agencies to enforce against revenue-related and trade offences.
We also contribute to efforts to safeguard the integrity and security of
the global supply chain by partnering regional and international counterparts
to enforce against different types of illicit trade.</p>
