If you receive emails, text messages, letters or other correspondences from companies claiming that Singapore Customs had withheld your consignments and instructed you to make payment to them before the detained goods could be released, BEWARE!

Singapore Customs does not demand payment for the release of goods. Any form of letters to instruct entities to make any form of duties/GST payment to third-party logistics operators is likely to be fake.
