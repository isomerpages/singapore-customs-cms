### **Singapore Customs – Report Duty/Goods and Services Tax (GST) Evasion and Other Illicit Trade**

Singapore Customs takes a serious view of import tax evasion and other violations of Customs laws relating to import, export and transhipment of goods. By reporting illicit trade practices, you will contribute to maintaining the integrity of Singapore’s trading system where individuals and businesses conduct trade fairly, and pay the correct amount of taxes.

##### **What is tax evasion?**
Tax evasion occurs when an individual or business has deliberately omitted to pay or under-pay duty/GST on imported goods, or obtained undue duty/GST refunds.

Examples of tax evasion include:
* Smuggling of goods into Singapore; 
* Under-declaration of value of the goods imported into Singapore;
* Under-declaration of the quantity of goods imported into Singapore;
* Falsifying declarations and documents submitted to Singapore Customs; or
* Diversion of tax-suspended goods from licensed premises into Singapore market.

Tell-tale signs that an individual or business may be evading duty/GST:
* Keeping two different sets of documents and accounts for the same transactions; or
* Sale of goods (e.g. liquor) that is below the cost of goods plus the duty/GST payable.

##### **Report tax evasion or fraud:**
