Singapore Customs would like to alert members of the public of a fake Singapore Customs website phishing for personal info and data. 

We would also like to assure members of the public that access to the official Singapore Customs website remains unaffected, and we will continue to monitor for such fake websites. 

Members of the public are advised to use only the official Singapore Customs website at [ https://www.customs.gov.sg/]( https://www.customs.gov.sg/) and the Networked Trade Platform at [ https://www.ntp.gov.sg/home/]( https://www.ntp.gov.sg/home/) for all informational and transactional needs concerning customs matters, respectively.
