Singapore Customs has been alerted by a member of the public on a letter bearing Singapore Customs’ crest instructing the person to pay duty and demurrage charges to a freight forwarding agent before detained goods could be released.

Singapore Customs wishes to clarify that we do not issue letters to instruct individuals to pay any form of charges to 3rd party logistics operators.
