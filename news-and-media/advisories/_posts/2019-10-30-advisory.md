<p>Singapore Customs has been alerted by a member of the public on a letter
bearing Singapore Customs’ crest instructing the person to pay duty and
demurrage charges to a freight forwarding agent before detained goods could
be released.</p>
<p>Singapore Customs wishes to clarify that we do not issue letters to instruct
individuals to pay any form of charges to 3rd party logistics operators.</p>
