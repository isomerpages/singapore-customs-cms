If you have received calls from unknown numbers, claiming to be from Singapore Customs, with some even requesting you to make payment for the release of goods held by Singapore Customs, BEWARE!

These text messages and calls were not made by Singapore Customs. We do not request any payment through text messages or calls. We take a serious view of such impersonation incidents as they undermine public trust in our department.
