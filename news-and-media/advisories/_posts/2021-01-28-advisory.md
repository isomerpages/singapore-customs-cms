<p>If you have received calls from unknown numbers, claiming to be from Singapore
Customs, with some even requesting you to make payment for the release
of goods held by Singapore Customs, BEWARE!</p>
<p>These text messages and calls were not made by Singapore Customs. We do
not request any payment through text messages or calls. We take a serious
view of such impersonation incidents as they undermine public trust in
our department.</p>
