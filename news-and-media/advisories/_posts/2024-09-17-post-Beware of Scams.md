Singapore Customs would like to alert the public about a circulating Scam iMessage.

The iMessage **FALSELY** claims to be from Singapore Customs by identifying itself as “S.G. Customs”.

We do **NOT** use “SGCustoms” (or any variation of this) as part of our corporate identity or on digital/social media platforms.

The iMessage further carries a suspicious link meant to deceive people into revealing personal information so that their “detained parcels” can be released. Singapore Customs does **NOT** send text messages seeking your information in exchange for the release of goods.

We take a serious view of such incidents as they undermine public trust in Singapore Customs.

We urge the public to be vigilant against such scams. Take the following precautions should you receive any suspicious text messages, especially from people you do not know:

* Do not follow the instructions and do not make any monetary payments if you are unable to verify that the sender is indeed a Singapore Customs official.
* Do not open any link in the text message or other digital platform as the content may be malicious.
* Do not provide your name, NRIC number, passport details, contact details, bank account or credit card details, or other personal details to the sender.
 
When in doubt,  you can always contact Singapore Customs at [customs\_feedback@customs.gov.sg](mailto:customs_feedback@customs.gov.sg) regarding any correspondence you receive from us.
