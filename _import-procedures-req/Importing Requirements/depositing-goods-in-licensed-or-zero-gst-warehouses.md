# Depositing Goods in Licensed or Zero-GST Warehouses

Dutiable goods imported and stored in a [licensed warehouse](/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/licensed-warehouse-scheme) do not incur duty and GST. Duty and GST are only payable when these goods are removed from the licensed warehouse into customs territory for local use.

Non-dutiable goods imported and stored in a [zero-GST warehouse](/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/zero-gst-warehouse-scheme) or through any IRASâ€™ GST suspension schemes (such as [Major Exporter Scheme](/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/iras-schemes/major-exporter-scheme) and [Import GST Deferment Scheme](/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/iras-schemes/import-gst-deferment-scheme-igds)) do not incur GST. GST is only payable when these goods are removed from the zero-GST warehouse into customs territory for local use.
