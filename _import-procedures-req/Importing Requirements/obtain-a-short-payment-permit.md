# Obtain a Short-Payment Permit

A short-payment permit application is required to be taken up to account for the short-fall in duty and/or GST paid for goods that had been imported and declared previously. This may include but not limited to the following scenarios:

-   [Overlanded goods](/businessses/importing-goods/overlanded-and-shortlanded-goods/) in excess of the quantity stated in the bill of lading or airway bill
-   Under-declaration or omission of cost, insurance, freight and all other charges incidental to the sale and delivery of the goods
-   Wrong invoice (with a lower value than invoice value) or currency type used in the declaration of payment permit
-   Samples, gifts, free-of-charge items provided by overseas supplier not declared in the payment permit

You should obtain the correct short payment permit:

-   In-Payment (GST including duty exemption) permit if only GST is short-paid
-   In-Payment (Duty) permit if only duty is short-paid
-   In-Payment (Duty and GST) permit if both duty and GST are short-paid

The previous permit number is to be declared in the “Previous Permit No.” field and “SPNOSTK” (“Short Payment Not Involving Updates To Stock”) in the “Place of Receipt Code” field. The short payment permit is for the purpose of duty and/or GST recovery only and cannot be used for cargo clearance.

If the transacted amount on the invoice is in a foreign currency, please use the options below to derive the amount short-paid in Singapore dollars:

-   The [Customs exchange rate](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports/customs-exchange-rates) on the date the initial In-Payment permit was approved; or
-   The selling rate quoted by a commercial bank on the date the initial In-Payment permit was approved for a foreign currency not listed in the Customs exchange rate

For the second option, you are required to declare the name of the bank, bank’s telephone number and the date which the rate was quoted in the "Trader’s Remarks” field of the short payment permit application.

If the invoice states the transacted amount in both foreign currency and its conversion into Singapore dollars, please use the pre-determined exchange rate in the invoice to derive the amount short-paid in terms of Singapore dollars.
