# Documents for Clearance of Goods

## Documents Required for Containerised Cargo

You should ensure the validity of the customs permit presented for clearance of your imports.

For containerised cargo, the container number and shipper seal number must be declared when applying for the customs permit.

**Importing by sea:** You are **not required** to present the customs permit and supporting documents to the checkpoint officers at the entry points.

**Importing by air or land:** You are **required** to produce the printed copy of the customs permit, and supporting documents such as invoice, packing list and Air Waybill/consignment note, to the checkpoint officers at the time of cargo clearance for verification:

An example of conditions in the customs permit indicating this requirement:

|  |  |
|--|--|
| **A1** |The goods and this permit with invoices, BL/AWB, etc must be produced for Customs clearance/ endorsement at a Free Trade Zone "In" Gate.|
|**A3**| The goods must be produced with this permit, invoices, BL/AWB, etc for Customs endorsement at an Airport Customs checkpoint or designated Customs office or station as required.|
|**H1**| The goods and this permit with invoices, BL/AWB, etc must be produced for Customs clearance at Woodlands Checkpoint / Tuas Checkpoint.|

## Documents Required for Conventional Cargo & Hand-Carried Goods

For conventional cargo and hand-carried goods, you should present the goods, printed copy of the customs permit, and supporting documents such as invoice, packing list and Bill of Lading/Air Waybill, to the checkpoint officers at the entry points for verification.

An example of conditions in the customs permit indicating this requirement:

|  |  |
|--|--|
| **A1** |The goods and this permit with invoices, BL/AWB, etc must be produced for Customs clearance/ endorsement at a Free Trade Zone "In" Gate.
| **A3** |The goods must be produced with this permit, invoices, BL/AWB, etc for Customs endorsement at an Airport Customs checkpoint or designated Customs office or station as required.
| **H1** | The goods and this permit with invoices, BL/AWB, etc must be produced for Customs clearance at Woodlands Checkpoint / Tuas Checkpoint.|

For a consignment which requires **partial clearance**, the same customs permit should be presented each time for endorsement till the whole consignment is completely cleared.

**Please note partial clearance is not allowed for goods brought in via Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints.**

## Documents Required for Cargo Clearance of Air Imports Granted GST Relief at Changi Airfreight Centre Checkpoint

GST relief and permit waiver is granted on non-controlled and non-dutiable air imports imported by post or air with a total [Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) value](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports) not exceeding S$400.00. To facilitate the cargo clearance of such air courier parcels/consignments at the Changi Airfreight Centre (CAC) Checkpoint, freight forwarders/handling agents are allowed to use a summary list, together with the invoice and House Airway Bill (HAWB)/consignment note for each parcel/consignment with a CIF value not exceeding S$400.00 containing only non-controlled and non-dutiable items.  

There is no GST relief for goods originally imported by land, sea or truck-flights and subsequently presented for clearance at CAC Checkpoint, even if the CIF value of the goods does not exceed S$400.  See [Circular No. 01/2021](/news-and-media/circulars/2021-01-15-Circular012021.pdf) for details.  For more information on how to determine the total CIF value of a parcel/consignment, please refer to [Circular No: 04/2016](/news-and-media/circulars/2016-03-16-Circular042016.pdf) and [Circular No: 21/2023](https://www.customs.gov.sg/files/circular%2021_2023.pdf) for more information.

The **summary list** is to be printed on A4-sized paper in a minimum font size of 12 and shall contain the following information stated below in English:

|  |  | 
|--|--|
| a. | Your company’s letterhead and indicated with the page number and total number of pages of the summary list;|
| b. | All items serialised and ordered alphabetically with the following information:|
|   | 1. corresponding parcel tracking number/ HAWB/ reference number;|
|   | 2. outer packing number (i.e. mailbag no);|
|   | 3. consignee name;|
|   | 4. consignee address;|
|   | 5. item CIF provided in S$; and |
|   | 6. total CIF value of all items under the same parcel tracking number/ reference number.|
|c. | An undertaking by your company (endorsed by a staff holding a managerial position or above) that:
|   | 1. the parcels/consignments imported using the summary list are non-controlled, non-dutiable and valued at S$400.00 or less;|
|   | 2. the parcels/consignments imported did not originally enter Singapore via land or sea;|
|   | 3. the staff’s name, designation, signature and email contact are clearly indicated on the Letter of Undertaking; and|
|   | 4. the company will pay any duty/GST not paid for the goods where GST relief is not granted, including goods which were first imported via land or sea.
| d. | Your company is to ensure that the individual parcels imported are labelled with its invoice and HAWB/consignment note.|

For clearance of **dutiable** and **controlled** goods as well as goods originally imported by land, sea or truck-flights (regardless of CIF value) and other goods with CIF exceeding S$400.00, a Customs In-Payment (GST) permit is required to account for each consignment, and the individual HAWB, commercial invoices, together with the Customs permit, are to be presented to the checkpoint officer for verification.
