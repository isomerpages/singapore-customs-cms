# Sealing and Unstuffing

Officers at the entry points may seal any package or container before releasing the goods. Such sealed goods must be unpacked or unstuffed under Customs’ supervision.

The local freight forwarder, declaring agent or importer must [e-file](http://eservices.customs.gov.sg/scripts/customs/supervision/supermenu.asp){:target="_blank"} for Customs’ supervision of unpacking or unstuffing at least 1 working day before the intended operation. [Fees](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/permits-documentation-and-other-fees) will be charged for the supervision.
