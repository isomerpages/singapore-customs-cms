<h1>Electronic Origin Data Exchange System (EODES) with China</h1>
<p>Established on 1 November 2019, the EODES enables the electronic submission
of Preferential Certificate of Origin (PCO) and the Certificate of Non-Manipulation
(CNM) between Singapore and China Customs.</p>
<p>With effect from 1 May 2020, China has implemented full transmission of
electronic PCO. This eliminates the need for hard copy PCO or CNM to be
dispatched overseas.</p>
<p>EODES shortens the transmission lead time and assures PCO authenticity,
thus reducing the goods’ time-to-market through faster Customs clearance.</p>
<p>With effect from 11 Dec 2025, the EODES has been extended to the Regional
Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). As such, for PCOs applied under
ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA), Singapore-China Free Trade Agreement
(CSFTA), or RCEP for shipments exported from Singapore to China, exporters
and their appointed Declaring Agent (DA)/freight forwarders may electronically
transmit the PCOs via EODES to China’s General Administration of Customs
(GACC) for preferential tariff claims. The e-service is available on the
Networked Trade Platform (NTP). ["Electronic Preferential Certificate of
Origin transmitted to The People's Republic of China" &gt; Government Services
&gt; e-service &gt; outbound enquiry &gt; Submit SG PCO ("ePCO")]</p>
<p>Importers who wish to claim preferential treatment for import of goods
from China to Singapore or to apply for a back-to-back PCO can also retrieve
the electronic PCO issued by China via the same e-service on NTP. ["Electronic
Preferential Certificate of Origin transmitted to The People's Republic
of China" &gt; inbound enquiry &gt; Electronic Preferential Certificate
of origin ("ePCO")]</p>
