# ATA Carnet

A foreign entity, such as a foreign exhibitor, can use an ATA Carnet to temporarily import goods into Singapore (excluding intoxicating liquors and tobacco) for display or use at exhibitions, fairs, or other similar events.

Import Permits are not required for goods imported using an ATA Carnet. For controlled goods, Carnet holders are required to seek the assessment from the respective Competent Authority prior to the import of the goods. Carnet holders can click [here](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/portlets/search/searchHSCA/searchInitHSCA.do) to determine if the goods they wish to temporarily import are under the purview of any Competent Authority.
