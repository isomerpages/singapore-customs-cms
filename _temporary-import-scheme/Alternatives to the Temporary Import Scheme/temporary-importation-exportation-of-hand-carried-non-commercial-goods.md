# Temporary Importation/Exportation of Hand-carried Non-commercial Goods

Travellers who wish to hand-carry items belonging to an organisation for activities, such as concerts, church and school camps, into or out of Singapore for non-commercial purposes may apply to import or export such items under GST relief, subject to Singapore Customs' approval.

## Application Procedures

1.  Seek approval from the Competent Authority if you are temporarily importing or exporting controlled goods. Please refer to the  [controlled goods for import](/businesses/importing-goods/controlled-and-prohibited-goods-for-import)  and  [controlled goods for export](/businesses/exporting-goods/controlled-and-prohibited-goods-for-export).
2.  Submit the following documents at least 5 working days before the date of arrival to/departure from Singapore:
    
    -   Cover letter detailing the purpose of temporary import/export
    -   Invitation letter/event advertisement/other documents to substantiate participation in the event
    -   Hotel reservation confirmation
    -   Any other documents as specified by Singapore Customs
    
    You may email the documents to [customs_documentation@customs.gov.sg](mailto:customs_documentation@customs.gov.sg) for assessment.
    
3.  Upon receiving approval from Singapore Customs, please produce Singapore Customs' approved declaration and supporting documents with the hand-carried items to checkpoint officers for clearance on your arrival into Singapore or departure from Singapore.

For hand-carried items intended to be imported into Singapore on a temporary import basis for commercial purposes, traders should obtain a Customs In-Non Payment (Temporary Consignment) permit via TradeNet  as per the requirements under the TIS.
