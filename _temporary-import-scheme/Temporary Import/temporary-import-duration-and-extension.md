# Temporary Import Duration and Extension

Goods may be temporarily imported into Singapore for a maximum of 6 months. If additional time is needed request, an extension may be applied through TradeNet. A maximum of 3 months may be applied for each extension request. Traders are required to provide reason(s) for extensions and relevant documents to support the requests.

## How to Apply for Extension

Submit an amendment application for the temporary import permit through TradeNet to amend the temporary import end date with the following documents in your submission of the TradeNet declaration:

1.  Cover letter detailing reason(s) for extension
2.  Commercial invoice
3.  Bill of Lading/Airway Bill
4.  Packing list
5.  For goods under repair: Documentation proof from repair workshop or service provider with details on repairs that have been completed/ongoing/yet to be carried out (e.g. service report, quotation or payment proof for repair works).
6.  For goods under exhibition: Documentation proof from the owner of the goods containing instructions or acknowledgement that the goods need to remain in Singapore for an extended period. Other documents such as brochures, poster or promotional materials on the intended display and locations.
7.  Any other documents as specified by Customs

The extension of temporary import permit is to be submitted before the temporary import period expires. You are required to amend the “Temporary Import End Date” field only and indicate the reason for amendment. All other permit fields should remain unchanged (e.g. permit validity period).
