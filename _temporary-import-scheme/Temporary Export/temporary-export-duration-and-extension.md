# Temporary Export Duration and Extension

The same exporter should apply for the corresponding [ In-Non-Payment (TCI)](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/types-of-import-permits/) permit and produce it, together with the goods, for clearance at the inward checkpoint.

For goods temporarily exported as trade samples or for repair purposes, these goods have to be re-imported into Singapore within three months from the date of export. For all other goods and purposes, there is no limit to the duration you may temporarily export the goods.  

You are required to provide the following documentary proof that the goods were GST-paid and previously temporarily exported from Singapore under an [Out (TCI)](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/exporting-goods/export-procedures/types-of-export-permits) permit:

-   Cover letter stating the purpose of the re-importation;
-   Temporary export permit
-   Both sets of import and export commercial invoices, bills of lading/air waybills and packing lists (if any);
-   Documentation to substantiate that the temporarily exported goods are locally produced, or payment permit for the goods if they are sourced overseas; and
-   Any other supporting documents as requested by Customs.
