# Additional Requirements

## Controlled Goods

Controlled goods require proper authorisation (advance notification, licence or certificate approval) from the relevant Competent Authorities (CAs) before they may be temporarily exported out of Singapore and subsequently re-imported.

Please use the [Harmonised System/Competent Authority (HS/CA) Product Code Search Engine](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/portlets/search/searchHSCA/searchInitHSCA.do){:target="_blank"} to check if the goods that you wish to import are controlled items. Fill in the description of the goods, Harmonized System (HS) Code or CA Product Code in the respective fields. If the goods are controlled items, the name and contact person of the CA will be indicated next to the item's HS Code. You may check with the contact person of the relevant CA on their licensing requirements of your goods directly.

## Non-Manipulation of Goods Temporarily Exported

Goods that are **temporarily** **exported out** of Singapore should not be subject to any manipulation such that it will change the form or function of the goods (for example, resulting in a change in its HS code). In the event there is a change, GST will be payable on the goods.

Goods must be identifiable to the satisfaction of customs officers that the goods are in the same condition as that when they were previously exported.

## GST and/Duty Payment

GST and/or duties are payable on any additional parts added to the temporarily exported goods when they are being re-imported. Please click [here](/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/re-importing-of-goods-sent-overseas-for-activities) for more information.
