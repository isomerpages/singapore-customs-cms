<p>An importer may be granted Goods and Services Tax relief on the re-importation
of goods meant for commercial and personal use, which are temporarily exported
for qualifying purposes (e.g. for repair) subject to certain conditions.</p>
<p>To qualify, a temporary export permit is required to be obtained prior
to the temporary export of the goods for the qualifying purpose (e.g. for
repair).</p>
<p>Individuals may engage a local freight forwarding agent to declare the
temporary export and re-import permit on their behalf and will be required
to submit the relevant support documents during the permit application.</p>
