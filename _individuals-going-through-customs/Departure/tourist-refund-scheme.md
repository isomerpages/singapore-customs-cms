# Tourist Refund Scheme

The Tourist Refund Scheme (TRS) is administered by Singapore Customs on behalf of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS).  The scheme allows tourists to claim a refund of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) paid on goods purchased from participating retailers if the goods are brought out of Singapore via Changi International Airport or Seletar Airport.

For more information on the scheme’s qualifying conditions and tourist eligibility criteria, please refer to IRAS’ webpage on  [Tourist Refund Scheme](https://www.iras.gov.sg/IRASHome/Schemes/GST/Tourist-Refund-Scheme/){:target="_blank"}.

## Where can I claim GST refund?
GST refund, subject to conditions of the scheme, can be claimed at these locations:

-   Changi Airport
-   Seletar Airport

## How do I process my GST refund?
Before departing from the airport, please proceed to the electronic TRS (eTRS) self-help kiosk to apply for your GST refund.  You will need to scan your physical passport to retrieve all eTRS transactions tagged to your passport.

-   **For check-in items:** Before checking-in your purchases, proceed to the eTRS self-help kiosks located at the Departure Check-in Hall (before Departure Immigration) to apply for your GST refund.
-   **For hand-carry items:** Proceed to the eTRS self-help kiosks located at the Departure Transit Lounge (after Departure Immigration) to apply for GST refund.

**Customs Inspection:** If you are notified at the kiosk to present your goods for physical inspection at the Customs Inspection Counter, you will have to present the following items  **in person**:

1) Goods which you have purchased;

2) Original invoice/receipt issued by the retailer clearly stating the price, description of the goods, serial number (if any); and

3) Physical passport and boarding pass/confirmed air ticket.
