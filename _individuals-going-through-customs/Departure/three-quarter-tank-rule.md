# Three-Quarter Tank Rule

Under the Customs Act 1960, Singapore-registered vehicles are required to have a minimum amount of motor fuel (at least three-quarters of the tank) when leaving Singapore via the land checkpoints. This is commonly referred to as the “three-quarter tank rule”.

The three-quarter tank rule is applied to all vehicles running on **petrol, diesel, and/or compressed natural gas (CNG).** For hybrid vehicles running on petrol and CNG, drivers should also ensure that both the petrol and CNG fuel tanks are at least three-quarters full.

Drivers who do not meet the rule may be issued with a composition sum of up to $500, or be prosecuted in court. Drivers are also required to perform a U-turn at the land checkpoints if they are caught committing the offence.

If the vehicle’s fuel gauge is tampered with, the driver may be charged in court for illegal alteration of the fuel measuring equipment. Please refer to the types of [customs offences](/individuals/going-through-customs/offences) for more information. 

To avoid any inconvenience to your overseas trip, Singapore Customs would like to remind drivers to ensure that their fuel tank is at least three-quarters full when exiting the land checkpoints.
