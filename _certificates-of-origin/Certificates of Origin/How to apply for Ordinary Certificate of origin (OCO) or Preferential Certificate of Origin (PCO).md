<h4><strong>Step 1: Register your Manufacturing Premises/New Product Line</strong></h4>
<p>Register using the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/mfr" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">manufacturer's application form</a>.</p>
<p>When submitting the application, please note that you are required to
furnish all supporting documents as listed out in <strong>Section E</strong> of
the application. Failure to do so may result in the application not being
processed.</p>
<p>Upon approval, each Manufacturer’s Registration will be valid for a period
of 2 years from the date of approval. A renewal notice will be sent to
the company’s Authorised Person listed in the account a month prior to
the expiry of the registration. The Authorised Person is required to follow
the instructions in the notice should they wish to renew the Manufacture’s
Registration.</p>
<p>You may update the company’s contact details or Authorised Person, <a href="https://go.gov.sg/updatemanufacturerreg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">via the online application form</a> to
Singapore Customs.</p>
<p>*Note: Singapore Customs may arrange to visit your factory to verify the
production processes for the goods specified in your application to ensure
that they meet the requirements. During such visits, financial and operation
records may also be inspected.</p>
<p>The typical processing time for a manufacturer's application is one month
from the date of receipt provided the submission is complete and accurate
with all supporting documents furnished.</p>
<p>(You may skip this step if you are already registered with us as a manufacturer
for the specific goods)</p>
<h4><strong>Step 2: Submit the Manufacturing Cost Statement</strong></h4>
<p>After registration, submit the manufacturing cost statement to Singapore
Customs for verification that the goods in question meet the origin criteria
under the respective Free Trade Agreements and Schemes.</p>
<p>The submission should be made using the latest <a href="https://go.gov.sg/coststatementfeb2024" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Manufacturing Cost Statement template</a>.
The cost statement will be valid for 1 year from the date of the manufacturing
cost statement.</p>
<p>The typical processing time for a Manufacturing Cost Statement is 7 working
days upon receipt of the submission provided the submission is complete
and accurate.</p>
<h4><strong>Step 3: Apply for Certificate of Origin via TradeNet</strong></h4>
<p>Apply for a CO with export permit under the respective Free Trade Agreements
or Schemes via TradeNet.</p>
<p>You may refer to this <a href="/files/businesses/ttsb-roo/Handbook_on_the_Application_Procedures_for_a_Certificate_of_Origin_via_TradeNet_and_Related_Administrative_Matters_Feb_2025__clean_.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">handbook</a> for
more information on how to apply for a CO and export permit via TradeNet.</p>
<h4><strong>Step 4: Collect the Certificate of Origin</strong></h4>
<p>The CO must be collected within 2 weeks from its approval date. The exporter
may authorise a person to collect the CO on their behalf.</p>
<p>The authorised person is required to produce the Letter of Authorisation <strong>issued by the exporter</strong> for
verification during collection:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><a href="https://go.gov.sg/letterofauthorisationforformde" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">For collection of Form D/E</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://go.gov.sg/letterofauthorisationforotherco" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">For collection of Certificate of Origin other than Form D/E</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Effective, 1 Apr 2016, all Letters of Authorisation for collection
of CO must be issued by the exporter unless a blanket <a href="/files/businesses/appointment-letter-for-blanket-authorisation-for-co-collection.docx" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">appointment letter</a> is
provided to an entity to collect the CO on their behalf. In such cases,
this letter from the exporter and the Letter of Authorisation from the
appointed entity must be provided during each CO collection.</p>
<p>Please ensure that the information on the CO is accurate and tick the
relevant check boxes before signing on the CO and dispatching it to your
overseas customer.
<br>Explanation on the check boxes are found on the overleaf notes of the
CO.</p>
<h2><strong>How to renew the validity of expired manufacturing cost statements?</strong></h2>
<p>You can renew the manufacturing cost statements by submitting a letter
of undertaking (LOU) via <a href="http://eservices.customs.gov.sg/scripts/customs/LOU_MCS/LOU1_Terms.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">e-filing</a>.</p>
<p>The letter would declare the goods of all models still qualify at the
prevailing origin criterion(a) under the respective Free Trade Agreements
or Schemes previously approved.</p>
<p>The typical processing time for an LOU application is two working days
from the date of receipt provided the submission is complete and accurate.</p>
