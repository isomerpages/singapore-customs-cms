## How to apply for ordinary or preferential Certificate of Origin for locally manufactured goods with Singapore Customs?

**Step 1: Register your Manufacturing Premises/New Product Line**

Register using the [manufacturer’s application form](https://go.gov.sg/mfr).

When submitting the application, please note that you are required to furnish all supporting documents as listed out in **Section E** of the application. Failure to do so may result in the application not being processed.

Upon approval, each Manufacturer’s Registration will be valid for a period of 2 years from the date of approval. A renewal notice will be sent to the company’s Authorised Person listed in the account a month prior to the expiry of the registration. The Authorised Person is required to follow the instructions in the notice should they wish to renew the Manufacture’s Registration. 

You may update the company’s contact details or Authorised Person, [via the online application form](https://go.gov.sg/updatetomanufacturerreg) to Singapore Customs. 

*Note: Singapore Customs may arrange to visit your factory to verify the production processes for the goods specified in your application to ensure that they meet the requirements. During such visits, financial and operation records may also be inspected. 

(You may skip this step if you are already registered with us as a manufacturer for the specific goods.)
    
**Step 2: Submit the Manufacturing Cost Statement**
    
After registration, submit the manufacturing cost statement to Singapore Customs for verification that the goods in question meet the origin criteria under the respective Free Trade Agreements and Schemes.
    
The submission should be made using the latest [Manufacturing Cost Statement template](https://go.gov.sg/coststatementapr2023). The cost statement will be valid for 1 year from the date of the manufacturing cost statement.
    
The typical processing time for a Manufacturing Cost Statement is 7 working days upon receipt of the submission provided the submission is complete and accurate.
    
**Step 3: Apply for Certificate of Origin via TradeNet**

Apply for a CO with export permit under the respective Free Trade Agreements or Schemes via TradeNet.

You may refer to this [handbook](/files/businesses/ttsb-roo/Handbook_on_the_Application_Procedures_for_a_COO_via_TradeNet_and_Related_Admin_Matters_Sep_2022.pdf) for more information on how to apply for a CO and export permit via TradeNet.
    
**Step 4: Collect the Certificate of Origin**

The CO must be collected within 1 month from its approval date. The exporter may authorise a person to collect the CO on their behalf.

The authorised person is required to produce the Letter of Authorisation **issued by the exporter** for verification during collection:

-   [For collection of Form D/E](https://go.gov.sg/letterofauthorisationforformde)
-   [For collection of Certificate of Origin other than Form D/E](https://go.gov.sg/letterofauthorisationforotherco)

Note: Effective, 1 Apr 2016, all Letters of Authorisation for collection of CO must be issued by the exporter unless a blanket [appointment letter](/files/businesses/appointment-letter-for-blanket-authorisation-for-co-collection.docx) is provided to an entity to collect the CO on their behalf. In such cases, this letter from the exporter and the Letter of Authorisation from the appointed entity must be provided during each CO collection.

Please ensure that the information on the CO is accurate and tick the relevant check boxes before signing on the CO and dispatching it to your overseas customer. 
<br> Explanation on the check boxes are found on the overleaf notes of the CO.

## How to renew the validity of expired manufacturing cost statements?

You can renew the manufacturing cost statements by submitting a letter of undertaking (LOU) via [e-filing](http://eservices.customs.gov.sg/scripts/customs/LOU_MCS/LOU1_Terms.asp){:target="_blank"}.

The letter would declare the goods of all models still qualify at the prevailing origin criterion(a) under the respective Free Trade Agreements or Schemes previously approved.
