## How to apply for back-to-back preferential Certificate of Origin with Singapore Customs?

The back-to-back preferential CO is issued by Singapore Customs for the re-export of goods based on the preferential CO issued by the first exporting party. The goods must be imported into Singapore and meet the conditions for it to be issued.
