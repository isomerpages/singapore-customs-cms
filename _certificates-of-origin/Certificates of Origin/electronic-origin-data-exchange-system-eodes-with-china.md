# Electronic Origin Data Exchange System (EODES) with China

Established on 1 November 2019, the EODES enables the electronic submission of Preferential Certificate of Origin (PCO) and the Certificate of Non-Manipulation (CNM) between Singapore and China Customs. 

With effect from 1 May 2020, China has implemented full transmission of electronic PCO. This eliminates the need for hard copy PCO or CNM to be dispatched overseas. 

EODES shortens the transmission lead time and assues PCO authenticity, thus reducing the goodsâ€™ time-to-market through faster Customs clearance. 

Exporters and their appointed declaring agents/freight forwarders should leverage on the e-service available on the Networked Trade Platform (NTP). ["Electronic Preferential Certificate of Origin transmitted to The People's Republic of China" > Government Services > e-service > outbound enquiry > Submit SG PCO ("ePCO")]

Importers who wish to claim preferential treatment for import of goods from China to Singapore or to apply for a back-to-back PCO can also retrieve the electronic PCO issued by China via the same e-service on NTP. ["Electronic Preferential Certificate of Origin transmitted to The People's Republic of China" > inbound enquiry > Electronic Preferential Certificate of origin ("ePCO")]
