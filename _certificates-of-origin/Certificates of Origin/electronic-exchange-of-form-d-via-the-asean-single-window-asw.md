## Electronic Exchange of Form D via the ASEAN Single Window (ASW)

The ASEAN Single Window (ASW) is an environment that connects and integrates the National Single Windows (NSWs) of ASEAN Member States (AMS), thereby allowing the electronic exchange of data between the AMS.

With effect from 1 Jan 2024, all AMS has implemented full transmission of electronic Form D. As such, the importing customs administration in AMS may reject hardcopy Form D presented for preferential tariff claims. 

You must apply for e-Form under ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) if you are exporting to:

-   Brunei Darussalam
-   Cambodia;
-   Indonesia;    
-   Lao PDR;    
-   Malaysia;    
-   Myanmar;    
-   The Philippines
-   Thailand; and    
-   Vietnam.
    
Under the live operation of the ASW, a Form D which is issued under ATIGA and is electronically transmitted (therein called ATIGA e-Form D) from Singapore to any of the above-mentioned AMS for an import will also enjoy preferential tariff treatment. No other Certificates of Origin can currently be transmitted via the ASW.

**Application Procedures**

There is no change made to the Form D application procedures in TradeNet. 

**For transmission of an ATIGA e-Form D**

* The exporter must first be registered with Singapore Customs to access Networked Trade Platform (NTP). 
* Once the Form D is approved, the applicant must access the approved Form D via a log in to www.ntp.gov.sg >Government Services > International Connectivity > ATIGA e-Form D.
*  At the ATIGA Form D (SG to AMS) Enquiry screen, select "Importing Country / Region" and input  the approved Form D reference number to locate it. 
*  After locating the approved Form D, the exporter or the authorised Declaring Agent can proceed to make adjustments and trigger the transmission of the ATIGA e-Form D to the importing country via the ASW.
