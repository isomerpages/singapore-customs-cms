# Notes for Isomer Team
Resource room has files in each of the resource categories - these resources are inaccessible on the CMS. If any existing resource files need to be modified, they have to be manually done. There is a fix available on the resource-file-migration branch, but due to the number of files changed, there may be existing issues we are unable to identify.
