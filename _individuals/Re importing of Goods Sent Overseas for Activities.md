# Re-importing of Goods Sent Overseas for Activities

Goods sent overseas may be re-imported into Singapore due to:

-   Re-import of temporary exported goods for approved purposes including repair, performances and exhibition
-   Re-import of goods stored or used in a Free Trade Zone
-   Return of damaged or rejected goods

Similar to imports, all re-imports of goods into Singapore incur Goods and Services Tax (GST) and/or duty payments. You may find out more about  [duties](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-and-fees/duties-and-dutiable-goods) and [GST](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/goods-and-services-tax-gst).

Please view the tabs below for more information on re-importing goods under different scenarios.

      <br>For goods (bona fide trade samples and goods manufactured, assembled or produced in Singapore) that are temporarily exported and have undergone any manipulation or processing while overseas, re-importing these goods will incur GST and/or duties.
	<p>For the re-importation of <b>non-dutiable goods </b>temporarily exported for repair where new parts (whether as replacement or in addition to the original parts) are added, GST relief granted is only applicable to the remaining original parts of the article re-imported and shall be contingent on the repairer certifying the details and values of the new parts added and upon payment of the GST on such added parts. However, if the repair has been carried out for no charge by the repairer on goods covered by a warranty or guarantee agreement, the relief hereby granted shall also apply to the new parts added. In the case of the re-import of any goods by a non-taxable person, the GST should be paid previously, and has not been refunded.
		<br><br>For the re-importation of <b>motor vehicles</b> temporarily exported for repair where new parts (whether as replacement or in addition to the original parts) are added, the GST relief and duty exemption granted is only applicable to the original parts of the motor vehicles and shall be contingent on the repairer certifying the details and values of the individual new parts added and upon payment of the tax and excise duty on the cost and <b>all other incidental charges (e.g. labour)</b> in respect of such added parts. In cases where repairs have been carried out for no charge on the motor vehicles covered by a warranty or guarantee agreement, the GST relief and duty exemption hereby granted shall also apply to the new parts added.
	<br><br>For new parts (whether as replacement or in addition to the original parts) added which are covered by a warranty or guarantee agreement where the repair had been carried out for no charge by the repairer, you should obtain from the repairer-
	<br>- A certificate confirming if new parts (whether as a replacement or in addition to the original parts) have been added; and
	<br>- An invoice on the individual new parts and labour for the repair, where applicable (otherwise, you are required to obtain and retain proof that the repair has been carried out for no charge by the repairer on goods covered by a warranty or guarantee agreement).
		<br><br>Where payment of GST and/or duty is required, you must obtain the following permits-
		<br>- <b>For the re-importation of non-dutiable parts</b>, a Customs In-Payment (GST) permit and the re-import Customs In-Non-Payment (Temporary Consignment –TCI) permit; or
		<br>- <b>For the re-importation of dutiable parts</b> (such as motor vehicle parts), a Customs In-Payment (Duty and GST) permit and the re-import Customs In-Non-Payment (Duty exemption and GST relief) permit with place of receipt as ‘VEHSG’.
		<br><br>The relevant permits and supporting documents (for example, commercial invoice, packing list and Bill of Lading/Airway Bill) must be produced to the checkpoint officers during import cargo clearance.</p>
