# OPCW Inspection Process

![](/images/ocpw.jpg)

## Inspection Notification

Once the inspection notification from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is received, the NA(CWC) will notify the selected facility immediately. The facility will be informed of the purpose of inspection, the expected inspection period, and the number of OPCW inspectors and NA(CWC) officers accompanying the inspection.

The OPCW inspectors are trained to conduct on-site inspections to verify the facility’s compliance to the provisions of the Convention. These inspectors are recruited from different Member States. They are employed solely by the OPCW on a contractual basis and represent the OPCW during each inspection mission to the inspected Member State.

## Site Preparation

Upon notification, the selected facility should begin preparations to facilitate the inspection process. The NA(CWC) will visit the facility to finalise the preparation work and to clarify any doubts.

## On-Site Inspection

The inspection will include a briefing of the facility’s operations, a site tour around the facility covering areas such as the reactors, waste treatment area, warehouse, maintenance workshop, laboratories and medical facility, followed by a review of the facility records of the relevant chemicals.

The OPCW may also conduct sampling and analysis to check for absence of undeclared scheduled chemicals.

During the inspection, NA(CWC) officers would act as intermediaries between the OPCW inspection team and the facility representatives to ensure the confidentiality of the facility’s information and that Singapore’s obligations to the Convention are met.

## Post-Inspection Activities

Once the inspection is completed, a draft of the preliminary findings report prepared by the OPCW inspectors will be extended to the NA(CWC) and the facility for review. All documents and materials provided to the OPCW inspectors would be returned.

A final inspection report would also be provided to the NA(CWC) and the facility for review.
