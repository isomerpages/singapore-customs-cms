# Notification Period

The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will notify NA(CWC) of an impending inspection. The notification period depends on the type of scheduled chemical at the facility.

| Schedule | Notification Period | Inspection Duration | 
|---|---|---|
| 1 | ≥ 24 hours | As required |
| 2 | ≥ 48 hours | ≤ 96 hours |
| 3 | ≥ 120 hours | ≤ 24 hours |
| Unscheduled Discrete <br> Organic Chemicals | ≥ 120 hours | ≤ 24 hours |

The NA(CWC) will notify the selected facility of the expected date of inspection and the number of OPCW inspectors and NA(CWC) officers accompanying the inspection.

The NA(CWC) will also visit the facility in advance to assist the facility operator in preparing for the OPCW inspection.
