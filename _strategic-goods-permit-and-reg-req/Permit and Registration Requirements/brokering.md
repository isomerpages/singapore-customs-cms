Brokering is the arrangement, negotiation, or the act of facilitating the arrangement or negotiation, of a contract to acquire or dispose controlled goods or technology, with reason to believe the contract will, or is likely to, result in the removal of the goods and technology from one foreign country to another.

Before engaging in any brokering activities, you must submit a brokering registration form or a brokering permit application to Singapore Customs.
