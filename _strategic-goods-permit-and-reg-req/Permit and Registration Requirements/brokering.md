# Brokering

Brokering is the arrangement, negotiation, or the act of facilitating the arrangement or negotiation, of a contract to acquire or dispose controlled goods or technology, with reason to believe the contract will, or is likely to, result in the removal of the goods and technology from one foreign country to another.

Before engaging in any brokering activities, you must submit a brokering registration form or a brokering permit application to Singapore Customs.

## Registering as a Broker

You should register as a broker with Singapore Customs at least 14 working days before brokering in arms, explosives and other items listed in the  [Strategic Goods (Control) (Brokering) Order 2019](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/SGCA2002-S534-2019?DocDate=20190801){:target="_blank"}.

**Step 1:**  Complete the [Application Form for Registration to Broker Goods](https://go.gov.sg/sgc-brokering-reg).

**Step 2:**  Attach the supporting documents, where applicable:

-   Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) Bizfile business profile of applicant
-   Technical specifications of the items to be brokered (for example, manuals, brochures, data sheets, operating instructions)
-   Other relevant supporting documents

**Step 3:**  Submit the completed form and supporting documents.

In addition, registered brokers are required to submit a  [half-yearly report on brokering activities](/eservices/customs-forms-and-service-links)  that have been carried out during that period. The report must be submitted to Singapore Customs by the 30th  day of June and December every year. Singapore Customs may also require the records to be audited and verified by an authorised officer at any time.

Your application should be processed within seven working days. Please ensure that the information and documents provided are complete. However, some applications may take a longer time to process, depending on the nature of the item, destination or parties involved in the transaction. To avoid any possible delay in your brokering activities, you are encouraged to submit your application two months ahead for our assessment and processing.

You will need a brokering permit if you:
