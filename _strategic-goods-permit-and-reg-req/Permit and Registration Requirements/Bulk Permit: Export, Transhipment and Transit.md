<h1>Bulk Permit: Export, Transhipment and Transit</h1>
<p>The Bulk Permit is a single approval for the export, re-export, transhipment
or transmission of strategic goods or their related technology. The Bulk
Permit is valid for a period determined by Singapore Customs. It benefits
businesses with a high transaction volume or short lead-time for order
fulfilment.</p>
<p>As long as the transaction is within the scope of the approved Bulk Permit,
its holders can apply for the TradeNet permit before lodging the cargo
with the sea port operators or air cargo ground handling agents, instead
of having to apply for an <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/files/businesses/tn4-1proceduresforstspermits(11042022).pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Individual Permit</a> 5
working days before the shipment. This enables the Bulk Permit holder to
enjoy greater certainty and efficiency in their operations.</p>

weapons precursors which are also controlled by other <a href="/businesses/national-single-window/overview/competent-authorities-requirements" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Competent Authorities (CAs)</a>,
