# Intangible Transfer of Technology (ITT)

The intangible transfer of technology (ITT) is the electronic transmission of controlled strategic goods technology in Singapore such as email or fax, or the act of making the controlled strategic goods technology available in Singapore on a computer or server, so that it becomes accessible to a person in a foreign country.

You should obtain an ITT permit if you are transmitting:

-   Any strategic goods software or technology; or
-   Any software/technology under the  [“catch-all” provision](/businesses/strategic-goods-control/permit-and-registration-requirements/individual-permit-export-transhipment-and-transit).

## Applying for an ITT Individual Permit

You should apply for your ITT permit  _at least 7 working days_  before the transmission of the controlled strategic goods technology from Singapore. Each ITT Individual Permit is valid for 1 year upon approval. There is no need to declare a TradeNet permit during the validity of the ITT Individual Permit.

**Step 1:** Complete the  [application form.](/eservices/customs-forms-and-service-links)

**Step 2**: Attach the supporting documents, where applicable:

-   Detailed technical specifications or write-up of the software or technology
-   Export Licence (and its English translation) from the originating country, or a confirmation from the originating country that they do not control the re-transfer of the software or technology
-   [End-User Statement](/eservices/customs-forms-and-service-links) for Strategic Trade Scheme Individual Permit from the party that you are transmitting the software/technology to
-   Other relevant supporting documents

**Step 3**: Submit the completed form and supporting documents.

Your application should be processed within 7 working days if the information and documents provided are complete. However, some applications may take longer to process, depending on the nature of the item, destination or parties involved in the transaction.
