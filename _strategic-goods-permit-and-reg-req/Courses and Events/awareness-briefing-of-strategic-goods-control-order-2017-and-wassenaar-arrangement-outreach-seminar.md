In line with international practices, Singapore Customs is in the process of updating our strategic goods control list, which will be prescribed in the new Strategic Goods (Control) Order (SGCO) 2017. This will be introduced in the third quarter of 2017.

As part of our efforts to outreach to the industry on the upcoming changes, Singapore Customs will be organising a joint Singapore Customs’ SGCO Awareness Briefing and WA Outreach Seminar 2017.Traders, declaring agents, carriers, cargo agents, freight forwarders, academics and researchers are encouraged to attend the briefings to familiarise themselves with the updates to ensure continuity in business compliance.

As one of the four multilateral export control regimes, the WA controls the exports and transfers of Conventional Arms and Dual-use Goods and Technologies. We encourage you to take this opportunity to get clarifications directly from the WA’s technical experts on their munitions and dual use control lists which Singapore adopts as part of our regular updates to the SGCO.
