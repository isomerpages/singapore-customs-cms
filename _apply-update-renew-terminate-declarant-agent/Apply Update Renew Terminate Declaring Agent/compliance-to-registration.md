# Compliance to Registration Requirements

   Registered DAs and Declarants must abide by the [Terms and Conditions for DAs](/documents/businesses/TCsDAfinal.pdf) and [Terms and Conditions for Declarants](/documents/businesses/TCsDeclarantfinalwithoutacknowledgement.pdf) respectively. These terms and conditions set out the responsibilities and due diligence expected of DAs and Declarants. More information can be found on [Circular No. 10/2010](/news-and-media/circulars/2010-07-22-Circular102010.pdf) and [Circular No. 12/2013](/news-and-media/circulars/2013-10-07-Circular122013.pdf).
    
   Non-compliance to the terms and conditions is an offence. Singapore Customs may impose penalties in the form of suspension or revocation of an entity’s status, downgrading of banding and the associated benefits, composition sums, court fines and/or jail term.
    
 **Note** : A DA, including its Declarants, once suspended or revoked, will not be able to submit permit applications via TradeNet.
    
   Examples of non-compliance include:
    
   -   The DE, DA, Declarant or Key Personnel of DE/DA has committed an offence or breached any terms and conditions imposed;
   -   The DE, DA, Declarant or Key Personnel of DE/DA ceases to be a ‘fit and proper’ person;
   -   The DA fails to renew its DA status within the stipulated renewal window;
   -   The DA fails to maintain a valid IBG with Singapore Customs;
   -   A breach of conditions issued in the customs permit, if any.
    
   In determining whether a DE, DA, Declarant or Key Personnel of a DE/DA is ‘fit and proper’, Singapore Customs takes into account all relevant facts or matters, including but not limited to the following:
    
   -   Whether the DE, DA or Declarant has committed, or is suspected of having committed, any offence or breached any terms and conditions;
   -   Whether any Key Personnel of the DE or DA is a ‘fit and proper’ person (for example, whether the Key Personnel has committed, or is suspected of having committed, any offence or breached any terms and conditions); or
    -   Whether the Declarant possesses the requisite knowledge in his roles and responsibilities or the practical experience in making declarations;
