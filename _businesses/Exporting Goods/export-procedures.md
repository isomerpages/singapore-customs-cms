# Export Procedures

In general, exporters must obtain the relevant Customs export permits before exporting goods from Singapore.

Goods and Services Tax (GST) and duty are not levied on goods exported from Singapore.

Generally, the exporter will be the party that issues the commercial invoice to his overseas customer. However, a third party (who is involved in taking the goods out of Singapore for export) may declare itself as the exporter, if the said party is:

1.	willing to declare itself as the exporter on behalf of the party that issues the commercial invoice to the overseas buyer; or

2.	acting as a consolidator for customers without a UEN.

The exporter is also required to declare the Free on Board (FOB) value of the goods in the export permit application.

Please refer to [Customs Circular No. 12/2013](/news-and-media/circulars) for more information on the responsibilities of an exporter.

A Customs export permit is required for:

-   Export of locally manufactured goods or local GST-paid goods
    
-   Export of goods from the Free Trade Zone (FTZ)
    
-   Export of dutiable goods from a licensed warehouse
    
-   Export of non-dutiable goods from a zero-GST warehouse, and goods under the Major Exporter Scheme

-   [Re-export of goods imported under the Temporary Import Scheme](/businesses/importing-goods/temporary-import-scheme)
    
-   [Temporary export of goods intended to be re-imported](/businesses/importing-goods/temporary-import-scheme)
    

A strategic goods export permit is required for the export of [goods controlled under the Strategic Goods (Control) Act](/businesses/strategic-goods-control/strategic-goods-control-list).

The table shows the period to submit your export permit application for the various types of goods:
