<h1>Export Procedures</h1>
<p>In general, exporters must obtain the relevant Customs export permits
before exporting goods from Singapore.</p>
<p>Goods and Services Tax (GST) and duty are not levied on goods exported
from Singapore.</p>
<p>Generally, the exporter will be the party that issues the commercial invoice
to his overseas customer. However, a third party (who is involved in taking
the goods out of Singapore for export) may declare itself as the exporter,
if the said party is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>willing to declare itself as the exporter on behalf of the party that
issues the commercial invoice to the overseas buyer; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>acting as a consolidator for customers without a UEN.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The exporter is also required to accurately declare the Free on Board
(FOB) value of the goods and the 'Country/Region of Origin' field in the
export permit application.</p>
