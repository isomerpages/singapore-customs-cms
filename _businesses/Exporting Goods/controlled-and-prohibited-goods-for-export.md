# Controlled & Prohibited Goods for Export

Controlled goods require proper authorisation (advance notification, licence or certificate approval) from  **Competent Authorities (CA)** before they may be exported from Singapore. You are advised to check if the goods are controlled using the description of the product, Harmonized System (HS) code or CA product code via the [HS/CA Product Code Search Engine](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/portlets/search/searchHSCA/searchInitHSCA.do){:target="_blank"}. If the item is subject to control you may check directly with the respective CAs on their licensing requirements. You may download the list of CAs' contact information via the HS/CA Product Code Search Engine.
