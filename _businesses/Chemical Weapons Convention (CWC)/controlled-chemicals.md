  - title: Unscheduled Discrete Organic Chemicals (DOCs)
    content: <br> An unscheduled discrete organic chemical (DOCs) refers to any
      chemical that belongs to the class of chemical compounds consisting of all
      compounds of carbon, except for its oxides, sulfides and metal carbonates.
      It is identifiable by name, structural formula (if known), and Chemical
      Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number (if assigned). It excludes
      <br><br> -   Oligomers and polymers whether or not containing phosphorus,
      sulfur or fluorine <br> -   Chemicals containing only carbon and metal
      <br> -   Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide (referred to as “oxides of
      carbon” in the above definition) <br> -   Carbon disulfide or carbonyl
      sulfide (referred to as “sulfides of carbon” in the above definition)
      <br><br> There are 2 types of DOCs <br><br> -   PSF-containing DOCs (Those
      that contain phosphorus, sulphur or fluorine) <br> -   Non PSF-containing
      DOCs (Those that do not contain phosphorus, sulphur or fluorine) <br>

    content: <br> Please refer to the [list of scheduled
      chemicals](/files/businesses/guide_to_nacwc_lic_-_with_sch_chem_list-(2020).pdf)
      to check if your product is controlled by the NA(CWC). <br><br> You may
      also check using the description of the goods, Harmonized System (HS) code
      or Competent Authority (CA) product code on this [search

      If the HS code is subject to control, the name of the CA and the
      chemical(s) that the CA controls will be indicated. You may check directly
      with the respective CAs on their licensing requirements. <br><br> If you

# Controlled Chemicals

The Chemical Weapons Convention lists 3 schedules of toxic chemicals, their precursors and an additional category of chemicals known as unscheduled discrete organic chemicals (DOCs).

The schedules are organised to reflect the risk posed by the chemical to the objectives of the Convention, with decreasing risk across the schedules. Although DOCs are not directly related to making chemical agents, the facilities built for their production (with quantity exceeding threshold limits) can potentially be converted to chemical weapons production facilities.


## Scheduled Chemicals

| Schedule | Description | Examples | Possible products categories |
|--|--|--|--|
| 1 |   Schedule 1 covers chemicals that possess lethal or <br> incapacitating toxicity and other properties that would <br> enable it to be used as a chemical weapon (Schedule 1A), <br> and their final stage precursors (Schedule 1B). <br><br> They pose a high risk to the objectives of the Convention and have little or no commercial application. |  Sarin <br><br> Saxitoxin <br><br> Ricin |  - Flame-retardant additive research (plastics, resins, fibres) <br>  - Medicinal &amp; pharmaceutical preparations |
| 2 |  Schedule 2 covers chemicals which are potential chemical warfare agents (Schedule 2A and 2A*), <br> and other chemical weapons precursors (Schedule 2B). <br><br> They pose a significant risk to the objectives of <br> the Convention and have moderate level of commercial application.|  Methylphosphonyl dichloride <br><br>   Arsenic trichloride |  - Insecticides <br> - Herbicides <br> - Epoxy resins <br> - Flame-retardant additive research (plastics, resins, fibres) <br> - Medicinal &amp; pharmaceutical preparations <br> -  Metal plating preparations |
| 3 |  Schedule 3 covers chemicals which had previously <br> been produced, stockpiled or used as a <br> chemical weapon. <br><br> They pose a risk to the objectives <br> of the Convention by virtue of its importance in <br> the production of one or more chemicals listed in <br>Schedule 1 or Schedule 2B. Schedule 3 chemicals have widespread commercial application. |   Triethanolamine <br><br>  Methyldiethanolamine |  - Pesticides <br> - Insecticides <br> - Toiletries <br> - Pharmaceutical <br> - Metal plating preparations <br> - Surfactants for detergents, oil drilling emulsions <br> - Corrosion inhibitors <br> - Soil fumigants |
