There are 4 types of declarations:

-   [Annual Declaration of Anticipated Activities for the coming year](/businesses/chemical-weapons-convention/declarations/annual-declaration-for-anticipated-activities-adaa)
-   [Annual Declaration of Past Activities for the preceding year](/businesses/chemical-weapons-convention/declarations/annual-declaration-for-past-activities)

-   [Advanced Notification of Transfer of Schedule 1 Chemical(s)](/businesses/chemical-weapons-convention/declarations/advanced-notification-on-transfer-of-schedule-1-chemicals)

The requirements to submit declarations to NA(CWC) are mandated under the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act. Every CWC licensee is required to submit declarations for declarable activities controlled by the NA(CWC).
