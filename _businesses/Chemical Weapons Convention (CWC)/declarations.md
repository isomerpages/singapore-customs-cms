Under the  [Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC),](/businesses/chemical-weapons-convention/introduction) every Member State is required to declare to the  [Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](http://www.opcw.org/){:target="_blank"} on controlled activities involving scheduled chemicals or unscheduled discrete organic chemicals (DOCs).

There are 4 types of declarations:

-   [Annual Declaration of Anticipated Activities for the coming year](/businesses/chemical-weapons-convention/declarations/annual-declaration-for-anticipated-activities-adaa)
-   [Annual Declaration of Past Activities for the preceding year](/businesses/chemical-weapons-convention/declarations/annual-declaration-for-past-activities)
-   [Ad-Hoc Declaration on Additionally Planned Activities](/businesses/chemical-weapons-convention/declarations/ad-hoc-declaration-on-additionally-planned-activities)
-   [Advanced Notification of Transfer of Schedule 1 Chemical(s)](/businesses/chemical-weapons-convention/declarations/advanced-notification-on-transfer-of-schedule-1-chemicals)

The requirements to submit declarations to NA(CWC) are mandated under the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act. Every CWC licensee is required to submit declarations for declarable activities controlled by the NA(CWC).
