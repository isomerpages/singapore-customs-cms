    content: <br> ✔ Ensure you obtain a valid CWC licence before you engage in any controlled activities with scheduled chemicals. <br> ✔ Check if the scheduled chemicals are also controlled under other regulations. For example, export of scheduled chemicals above certain concentration thresholds would require the strategic goods export permit. <br> ✔ Check the list of OPCW [Member States](https://www.opcw.org/about-us/member-states){:target="_blank"} and the relevant import and export restrictions for the scheduled chemicals in these Member States. <br> ✔ Perform checks to ensure that the end-user is a legitimate customer and not a sanctioned entity. <br> ✔ Ensure you apply for the correct permit type and fill up all the mandatory fields.

# Offences

Singapore Customs is the National Authority (NA) for the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).

If you wish to produce, process, consume, store, import, export, transfer or distribute chemicals controlled under the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act (CWPA), you would need to:

-   Obtain the CWC licence from the NA(CWC)
-   Meet regulatory and declaration requirements under the CWPA

Singapore Customs takes a serious view of the offences under the CWPA and will not hesitate to take enforcement action. You are reminded to exercise due diligence if you are involved in activities relating to controlled chemicals in or outside of Singapore. You should check for updates on CWC licensing matters regularly.

## Examples of common offences

   -   Failure to obtain a licence or comply with the conditions of a licence such as for the use, production, acquisition or transfer of scheduled chemicals or discrete organic chemicals
        
        -   Failure to apply for an increase in the licensed quantity of a scheduled chemical
    
   -   Refuse or fail, without reasonable cause, to give to Singapore Customs periodic reports relating to chemicals and facilities, and to maintain records relating to such chemicals and facilities
        
        -   Failure to submit to Singapore Customs the Annual Declaration of Past Activities
        -   Failure to declare a complete and correct import permit declaration
        -   Failure to indicate Customs Procedure Code (CPC), CWC licence number, NA (CWC) product code and purity of chemical
    
Penalties for offences under the CWPA and relevant sections of the Regulation of Imports and Exports Act (RIEA) include seizure and forfeiture of goods, fines and imprisonment. Singapore Customs may offer to compound offences for a sum not exceeding S$5,000 per offence.
