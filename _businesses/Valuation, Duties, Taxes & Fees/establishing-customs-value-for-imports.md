# Establishing the Customs Value

[Customs](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-and-fees/duties-and-dutiable-goods) and/or [excise duty](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-and-fees/duties-and-dutiable-goods)  (with ad valorem rates) and  [Goods and Services Tax (GST)](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/goods-and-services-tax-gst) are levied on the customs value of imports.

However, some imports can:

-   [Qualify for preferential tariff treatment](/businesses/certificates-of-origin/claiming-preferential-tariff-treatment-for-dutiable-imports)
-   Be exempted from duties refer to  [Customs (Duties Exemption) Order](/businesses/acts-and-subsidiary-legislation/customs-act/){:target="_blank"} and Section 2(1A) of  [Customs (Duties) Order](/businesses/acts-and-subsidiary-legislation/customs-act/){:target="_blank"}
-   Be  [exempted from GST](/businesses/acts-and-subsidiary-legislation/goods-and-services-tax){:target="_blank"}

## Transaction Value Method

The transaction value method is first considered in establishing the customs value, which is the *Cost, Insurance, and Freight (CIF) value*^ under International Commercial Terms (incoterms).

To establish the customs value using this method, all other charges incidental to the sale and delivery of the imports must be added to the transaction value or the price paid or payable for the imports. Examples of these charges include selling commissions, assists (materials supplied by the importer), packing costs, proceeds of resale accruing to the seller, royalties and licence fees, freight and insurance charges.

If any component of the customs value is settled in a [foreign currency](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports/customs-exchange-rates), that value should be converted to Singapore Dollars using the current selling rate of that currency in Singapore, at the time when customs duty or excise duty is paid for the imported goods.

**Example 1**:

Company A bought 2 cartons of vitamins from Supplier B on  *Ex Works (EXW) incoterms*^^.

|  |  |
|--|--|
| Cost of vitamins | S$1,000 |
| Selling commission | S$100 |
| Cost of inland transportation to port of exportation | S$150 |
| Handling and document charges at port of exportation | S$200 |
| Cost of overseas freight | S$300 |
| Cost of insurance for shipment | S$50|

Therefore, the customs value should be the sum of all the costs, which is S$1,800.

**Example 2**:

Individual A purchased a bag listed for sale on an online website by a foreign seller. B (a local service provider) arranged for the bag to be collected from the foreign seller. The bag would then be stored in an overseas holding area, packaged and then shipped to Singapore. For the services rendered, B charged individual A a concierge/handling fee in addition to the cost of international freight. No insurance was purchased.

|  |  |
|--|--|
| Cost of bag | S$400 |
| Handling charges | S$20 |
| Cost of overseas freight | S$30 |
| Cost of insurance for shipment | Nil |

The customs value should be the sum of all the costs, which is S$450. All costs incidental to the delivery of the bag to Singapore should be included for the purposes of GST payment.

## Conditions for Transaction Value Method

Using the transaction value method by Singapore Customs is subject to these conditions:

-   There must be evidence of a sale. Such evidence may be in the form of commercial invoices, sale contracts, purchase orders, etc
-   There must not be restrictions on the use of the goods by the buyer
-   The sale or price is not subject to conditions for which a value cannot be determined with respect to the goods being valued. Examples include:
-   Seller establishes the price of the imported goods on condition that the buyer will also buy other goods in specified quantities
-   Price of semi-finished goods is established by the seller on condition that the buyer will give the seller a specified quantity of the finished goods
-   It must be shown that the transaction value has not been affected by any relationship between the importer and supplier

## Other Valuation Methods

If the transaction value method cannot be used, the following alternatives will be used to determine the customs value:

-   Identical or similar goods value - the transaction value of identical or similar goods sold for export to Singapore
-   Deductive value - the sale price of the goods in Singapore, adjusted for costs incurred after shipment
-   Computed value - the value based on cost of production, general expenses and profits in the country of origin of the imported goods
-   Residual valuation - the value determined by Singapore Customs, based on flexible interpretation of all the previous methods
