# Duties & Dutiable Goods

All dutiable goods imported into or manufactured in Singapore are subject to customs duty and/or excise duty.

**Customs duty** is duty levied on goods imported into Singapore, excluding excise duty.  **Excise duty**  is duty levied on goods manufactured in, or imported into, Singapore.

The duties are based on ad valorem or specific rates. An ad valorem rate is a percentage of the goods’ customs value (for example, 20% of the customs value). A specific rate is a specified amount per unit of weight or other quantity (for example, S$388.00 per kilogramme).

There are 4 categories of dutiable goods:

-   Intoxicating liquors
-   Tobacco products
-   Motor vehicles
-   Petroleum products and biodiesel blends

Please refer to the  [list of dutiable goods](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/duties-and-dutiable-goods/list-of-dutiable-goods) for their respective duty rates. All other products are non-dutiable.

Examples on the calculation of duties payable:

## 1. Intoxicating liquors

a) For alcoholic products with duty rates based on per litre of alcohol  

*Duties payable = Total quantity in litres x Customs and/or excise duty rate x Percentage of alcoholic strength*

Company A imports 75 litres of stout with alcoholic strength of 5%. Assuming the customs and excise duties for stout is S$16 and S$60   per litre of alcohol respectively:

As both customs and excise duties are levied on the import of stout,

the duties payable = 75 x (S$16 + 60) x 5% = S$285
  
b) For alcoholic products with duty rates based on dutiable content (weight/volume)

*Duties payable = Total dutiable quantity in kilogrammes x Customs duty rate*

If 1 kilogramme of alcoholic composite concentrates contains 0.2 kilogramme of powdered alcohol,

the duties payable = 0.2kg x S$113 = S$22.60

## 2. Tobacco products
  
a) All tobacco products except cigarettes

*Duties payable = Total weight (in kilogrammes) x Excise duty rate*

Company A imports 100 kilogrammes (kgm) of tobacco stems. Assuming the excise duty for tobacco stems is S$388 per kilogramme:

Duties payable = 100 x S$388 = S$38,800

b) Cigarettes

*Duties payable = Total number of sticks x Weight of individual sticks (every gramme or part thereof) x Excise duty rate*

Company A imports 100 sticks of cigarettes weighing 1.5 grammes each. Assuming the excise duty for cigarettes is 42.7 cents for every gramme or part thereof of each stick:

Since the weight of each cigarette is between 1 and 2 grammes, the weight to be taken to calculate the duties payable is 2 grammes.

Hence, duties payable = 100 x 2 x S$0.427 = S$85.40  
  
## 3. Motor vehicles

*Duties payable = Customs value x Excise duty rate*
  
Company A imports a motor car that was bought at S$100,000 on [Free on Board (FOB) incoterms](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports/flat-rates-for-freight-and-insurance). The overseas freight, handling and insurance charges to ship the car to Singapore cost S$1,000. Assuming the excise duty for motor cars is 20% of the customs value:

Customs value of car = S$101,000

Duties payable = S$101,000 x 20% = S$20,200  
  
## 4. Petroleum and biodiesel blends 

a)  Petroleum products

*Duties payable = Total volume x Excise duty rate*

Company A imports 100 litres of unleaded,unblended motor spirit of RON 97 and above. Assuming the excise duty for unleaded,unblended motor spirit of RON 97 and above is S$7.90 per dal (1 dal = 10 litres):

Duties payable = S$7.90 x 10 = S$79  
  
b) Compressed natural gas (Cng)

*Duties payable = Total weight x Excise duty rate*

Company A imports 50 kilogrammes of compressed natural gas. Assuming the excise duty for compressed natural gas is S$0.20 per kgm:

Duties payable = S$0.20 x 50 = S$10  
  
c) Biodiesel blend

*Duties payable = Volume of diesel x Excise duty rate*

Company A imports 1,000 litres of biodiesel blend, comprising 100 litres of diesel. Assuming the excise duty for diesel is S$2.00 per dal (1 dal = 10 litres):

Duties payable = S$2 x 10 = S$20
