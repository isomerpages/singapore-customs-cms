# Licensed Warehouse Scheme

## What is it?

The Licensed Warehouse (LW) Scheme allows approved companies to store imported dutiable goods, namely liquor, tobacco, motor vehicles,  [petroleum and biodiesel blends](/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/petroleum-licences), for an indefinite period of time in a designated area licensed by Singapore Customs, with the duty and Goods and Services Tax (GST) suspended. This designated area is termed as licensed premises.

Duty and GST will be payable when these goods are removed from the licensed warehouse for local use or consumption. Duty and GST are not payable when these goods are removed for export, or when supply or sale of these goods takes place while they are in the warehouse.

You may refer to an  [overview of the procedures](/files/businesses/overview1.doc)  for storing dutiable imports in licensed warehouses.

## Types of Licences under the LW Scheme

There are 3 licence types to cater to the different needs of companies:

-   Licensed Warehouse Type I
-   Licensed Warehouse Type II
-   Licensed Warehouse Type III

The level of facilitation accorded, as well as the criteria on the company’s record-keeping and internal controls standard, increase from Type I to Type III.

Type I and II licensees need to qualify for the “Standard” and “Intermediate” bands under the  [TradeFIRST](/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/trade-first) framework respectively, while Type III licensees need to qualify for the “Enhanced” or the “Premium” bands.

A summary of the benefits for the 3 LW licence types can be found in the [Licensed Warehouse Handbook](/files/LW_Handbook_Dec_2024.pdf).

## How to Qualify?

To qualify for the Licensed Warehouse Scheme, the company must:

-   Be GST-registered with the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore
-   Have a valid  [Customs Account](/businesses/new-traders-and-registration-services/registration-services/activate-customs-account)
-   Have good compliance records with Singapore Customs
-   Ensure the premises to be licensed is a storage-based facility with security measures in place
-   Have good stock record-keeping and warehouse procedures
-   Be responsible for the security, accountability and control of the dutiable goods
-   Undergo  [TradeFIRST](/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/trade-first) assessment and meet all the mandatory criteria while attaining the minimum band to qualify for the respective licence types under the LW Scheme

The processing time for licences under the LW Scheme is generally 3 to 4 months from the complete submission of relevant documents. The duration may vary depending on the complexity of the application. We suggest that applicants conduct a TradeFIRST self-assessment to ensure they meet all the mandatory criteria for the schemes they are applying for before submitting their application.

## Licence Fee

An annual licence fee is payable upon issuance of the licence. It is based on the projected potential duty*  or the average past monthly duty**  of the dutiable goods stored in the licensed premises:


| Projected Potential Duty or Average Past Monthly Duty | Licence Fee for the period starting on or after 1 Jan 2024 but before 1 Jan 2025 | Licence Fee for the period starting on or after 1 Jan 2025 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| S$1 million or less     | S$2,990     | S$3,480     |
| More than S$1 million but less than S$10 million     | S$4,785    | S$5,570     |
| S$10 million or more   | S$21,000    | S$21,000    |

*Projected potential duty is the total customs and excise duties of the projected maximum quantity of goods at any one time in the proposed licensed premises.

**Average past monthly duty refers to the average of the total customs and excise duties of all goods stored in the intended licensed premises on the 1st of each month during the period of 12 months (or, if the premises has been used to store goods for a shorter period, that shorter period) before the date of the application.

## Customs Supervision
