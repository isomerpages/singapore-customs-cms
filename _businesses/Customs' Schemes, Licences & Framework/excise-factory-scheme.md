# Excise Factory Scheme

## What is it?

An excise factory is a designated area licensed by Singapore Customs for manufacturing and storing  [dutiable goods](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-and-fees/duties-and-dutiable-goods), namely liquor, tobacco, motor vehicles, compressed natural gas, petroleum and biodiesel blends. This designated area is also known as licensed premises. Excise duty and Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be suspended if the manufactured goods are stored in the licensed premises.

Under the Excise Factory Scheme (EFS), activities such as bottling, blending, compounding, varying intoxicating liquors as well as refining and treating of  [petroleum or biodiesel blends](/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/petroleum-licences)  are allowed.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**1.** **Where can I find the Harmonised System (HS) codes and duty rates of dutiable goods?**

Find out more about  [Duty Rates of Dutiable Goods](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/duties-and-dutiable-goods/list-of-dutiable-goods) and access the  [Harmonised System (HS) Product Code Search Engine](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/portlets/search/searchHSCA/searchInitHSCA.do).

**2.** **How do I compute the excise duty payable on locally manufactured liquors?**

**Formula**

Total excise duty = *Total quantity in litres x Excise duty per litre of alcohol x % of alcoholic strength*

For example, the total excise duty payable on 1,000 litres of locally manufactured stout with 5% alcoholic strength will be:  
1,000 litres x $60 x 0.05 = $3,000.

**3.** **Do I need to seek prior approval from Singapore Customs to import apparatus or power-operated machinery for the manufacture of dutiable goods?**

Yes, prior approval from Singapore Customs is required before these goods are imported.

**4.** **Is the licence subject to renewal?**

Yes, the renewal of the licence is dependent on:

-   Payment of the annual licence fee
-   Lodgement of the Banker’s Guarantee or Insurance Bond, if applicable
-   Compliance records with Singapore Customs
-   Outcome of the  [TradeFIRST](/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/trade-first) assessment

**5.** **Is the licence transferable?**

The licence is strictly non-transferable. There should be no sub-letting of the excise factory. The manufacturer is responsible for the movement of all goods in and out of the excise factory.

**6.** **How do I declare Customs permits?**

Customs permits can be declared through  [TradeNet](/businesses/national-single-window/overview).

Find out more about  [Permit Declaration](/businesses/new-traders-and-registration-services/overview).

**7)** **What are the specific requirements to operate a Microbrewery in Singapore?**
