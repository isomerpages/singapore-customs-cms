# Air Store Bond Scheme

## What is it?

An air store bond is a designated area licensed by Singapore Customs for storing dutiable goods, namely liquor, with the duty and Goods and Services Tax (GST) suspended. These dutiable goods are meant for supply to the various airlines operating out of Changi Airport terminals. The designated area is also termed as licensed premises.

The licensed premises must be physically demarcated and separated from other areas, while the non-licensed premises may be used for other purposes.

Your company can enjoy improved cash flow under the Air Store Bond Scheme.

## How to Qualify?

To qualify for the Air Store Bond Scheme, the company must:

-   Be GST-registered with the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore

-   Be responsible for the security, accountability and control of the dutiable goods
-   Obtain approval from the Changi Airport Group to operate an air store bond
-   Undergo  [TradeFIRST](/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/trade-first) assessment and meet all the mandatory criteria while attaining  “Enhanced” Band

## Licence Fee

An annual licence fee is payable upon issuance of the licence. It is based on the projected potential duty* or the average past monthly duty** of the dutiable goods stored:



| Projected Potential Duty | Licence Fee for the period stating on or after 1 Jan 2024 but before 1 Jan 2025 | Licence Fee for the period starting on or after 1 Jan 2025 |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- |
| S$1 million or less     | S$2,990    | S$3,480     |
| More than S$1 million but less than S$10 million     | S$4,785     | S$5,570     |
| S$10 million or more  | S$21,000    | S$21,000     |


*Projected potential duty refers to the total customs and excise duties of the projected maximum quantity of goods that can be stored at any one time in the intended licensed premises.  
**Average past monthly duty refers to the average of the total customs and excise duties of all goods stored in the intended licensed premises on the 1st of each month during the period of 12 months (or, if the premises has been used to store goods for a shorter period, that shorter period) before the date of the application.
