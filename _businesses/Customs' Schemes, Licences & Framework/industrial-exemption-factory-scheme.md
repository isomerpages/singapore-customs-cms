# Industrial Exemption Factory Scheme

## What is it?

The Industrial Exemption Factory Scheme is a duty exemption scheme for industries that use dutiable goods (except diesel products and biodiesel blends) as raw materials solely to manufacture non-dutiable finished goods.

Under this scheme, dutiable goods (except diesel products and biodiesel blends) would be duty exempted as long as they are used solely for the manufacture of non-dutiable finished goods and stored at the place of manufacture approved by Singapore Customs.
