# Zero-GST Warehouse Scheme

## What is it?

The Zero-GST Warehouse Scheme (ZGS) allows approved companies to store  **imported non-dutiable**  goods for an indefinite period of time in a designated area licensed by Singapore Customs, with the Goods and Services Tax (GST) suspended. This designated area is termed as licensed premises.

GST is payable when these goods are removed from the zero-GST warehouse for local use or consumption. GST is not payable when these goods are removed for export, or when supply or sale of these goods takes place while they are in the warehouse.

You may refer to an  [overview of the procedures](/files/businesses/overview2.doc)  for storing non-dutiable imports in zero-GST warehouses.

## Types of Licences under ZGS

There are 3 licence types to cater to the different needs of companies:

-   Zero-GST Warehouse Type I
-   Zero-GST Warehouse Type II
-   Zero-GST Warehouse Type III

The level of facilitation accorded, as well as the criteria on the company’s record-keeping and internal controls standard, increase from Type I to Type III.

Type I and II licensees need to qualify for the “Standard” and “Intermediate” bands under the  [TradeFIRST](/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/trade-first) framework respectively, while Type III licensees need to qualify for the “Enhanced” or the “Premium” bands.

A summary of the benefits for the 3 zero-GST warehouse licence types can be found in the [Zero-GST Warehouse Scheme Handbook](/files/Zero_GST_Warehouse_Scheme_Handbook__Dec_2024_.pdf).

## How to Qualify?

To qualify for the Zero-GST Warehouse Scheme, the company must:

-   Be GST-registered with the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS)
-   Have a valid  [Customs Account](/businesses/new-traders-and-registration-services/registration-services/activate-customs-account)
-   Have good compliance records with Singapore Customs and IRAS
-   Ensure the premises to be licensed is a storage-based facility with security measures in place whereby:
    -   The location is primarily used for warehousing of goods; and
    -   Tenant/leaseholder has the legal authority and control over the premises, including the possession of tenancy agreement with the landlord, and the right to install or alter any security features or plans at the location as required by Singapore Customs
-   Have good stock record-keeping and warehouse procedures
-   Be responsible for the security, accountability and control of the goods
-   Undergo  [TradeFIRST](/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/trade-first) assessment and meet all the mandatory criteria while attaining the minimum band to qualify for the respective Zero-GST warehouse licence types

The processing time for licenses under the ZGS Scheme is generally 3 to 4 months from the complete submission of relevant documents. The duration may vary depending on the complexity of the application. We suggest that applicants conduct a TradeFIRST self-assessment to ensure they meet all the mandatory criteria for the schemes they are applying for before submitting their application.
