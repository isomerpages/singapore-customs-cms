## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**What is the difference between a container freight warehouse, a zero-GST warehouse and a licensed warehouse?**

Zero-GST and licensed warehouses are meant for long-term storage of non-dutiable and dutiable goods respectively, with the duty and/or GST suspended.

Container freight warehouses are for the purposes of bulk breaking and consolidation activities, and  **not**  meant for the long-term storage of goods.  Only non-dutiable, non-controlled and non-strategic goods can be brought into a container freight warehouse.
