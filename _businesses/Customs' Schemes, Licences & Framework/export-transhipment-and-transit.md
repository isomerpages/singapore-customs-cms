# Strategic Trade Scheme Bulk Permit: Export, Transhipment and Transit

The Bulk Permit is a single approval for the export, re-export, transhipment or transmission of strategic goods or their related technology. The Bulk Permit is valid for a period determined by Singapore Customs. It benefits businesses with a high transaction volume or short lead-time for order fulfilment.

As long as the transaction is within the scope of the approved Bulk Permit, its holders can apply for the TradeNet permit before lodging the cargo with the sea port operators or air cargo ground handling agents, instead of having to apply for an  [Individual Permit](https://www.customs.gov.sg/files/businesses/tn4-1proceduresforstspermits(11042022).pdf) 5 working days before the shipment. This enables the Bulk Permit holder to enjoy greater certainty and efficiency in their operations.

## Qualifying for the Bulk Permit

To qualify for the Bulk Permit, you must:

-   Have good compliance records
-   Undergo  [TradeFIRST](/businesses/customs-schemes-licences-framework/trade-first) assessment and meet all the mandatory criteria while attaining the minimum “Enhanced” band
-   Implement an effective internal compliance programme (ICP)

The 7 ICP elements are:

-   Company’s commitment
-   Nomination of strategic goods control officer(s)*
-   Product screening
-   End-user screening
-   Record keeping
-   Awareness and training
-   Audits

*The appointed strategic goods control officer(s)/administrator(s) must be based in Singapore or remain contactable via a Singapore contact. The personnel must also be familiar with the SGCA and its Regulations and other related domestic legislations.

You may refer to Annex A of the [STS handbook](/files/STS_Handbook___updated_Dec_2024.pdf) for more details.

## Applying for Bulk Permit

You may apply for a Bulk Permit by completing this  [application form](https://go.gov.sg/sts-bulk) and submitting the form, [TradeFIRST Self-Assessment Checklist ](https://go.gov.sg/tradefirstchecklist) and supporting documents via the contact details listed in the form to the Schemes &amp; Engagement Branch.

Once the application is received, an officer will be assigned as Singapore Customs’ contact point to the company for the assessment.

We will conduct a TradeFIRST assessment on the company during a site validation, which includes assessment on the effectiveness of the company’s ICP. We would inform the company on the application outcome, the TradeFIRST band which the company is placed in and provide the TradeFIRST assessment report to the company.

## Applying for TradeNet Permit for Pre-approved Bulk Permit

If your strategic goods transactions are pre-approved under the Bulk Permit, you should apply for a TradeNet permit before lodging the cargo with the sea port operators or air cargo ground handling agents.

For the transfer of strategic goods such as arms, munitions and chemical weapons precursors which are also controlled by other  [Competent Authorities (CAs)](/businesses/national-single-window/overview/competent-authorities-requirements), you need to submit only one TradeNet permit application, as the application will also be routed to the relevant CAs for processing.

## Key Responsibilities of a Bulk Permit Holder

A Bulk Permit holder must:

-   Notify Singapore Customs of any changes made to your ICP, company structure, internal process or trade compliance team/Strategic Goods Control Officer (SGCO) within 14 days of the change
-   Ensure all transactions made under the Bulk Permit are within the scope of approval of the permit
-   Ensure the goods, technology or documents to be exported, re-exported, transhipped or transmitted under the Bulk Permit are not intended or likely to be used, wholly or in part, for, or in connection with, activities related to any nuclear, chemical or biological weapons; or missiles capable of delivering such weapons
-   Ensure that any goods or technology transfer made under the Bulk Permit is not transferred to United Nations Security Council–sanctioned countries or entities
-   Maintain records of strategic goods transactions for at least 5 years

Please refer to Section 4.9 of the [STS handbook](/files/STS_Handbook___updated_Dec_2024.pdf)

*Local registered entities are required to take up their own Bulk Permit and the Bulk Permit shall not be transferred to any other person/company.
