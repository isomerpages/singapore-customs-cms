# Cargo Agent's Import Authorisation Scheme

## What is it?

The Cargo Agent’s Import Authorisation (CAIA) Scheme allows cargo agents to take delivery of their air cargoes from ground handling agents before obtaining all the relevant customs permits from the importers or partner cargo agents handling the house shipments. The CAIA cargo agents can then break-bulk the cargoes in their warehouses located within the Changi Free Trade Zone.

Cargo agents cannot use this scheme to take delivery of air cargoes that contain goods controlled by  [Competent Authorities (CAs).](/businesses/national-single-window/overview/competent-authorities-requirements)

You may use this  [search engine](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/portlets/search/searchHSCA/searchInitHSCA.do){:target="_blank"} to check if the goods are controlled, using the description of the goods, Harmonised System (HS) code or CA product code. If the HS code is subject to control, the name of the CA will be indicated next to the HS code. You may check directly with the respective CA on their licensing requirements.

## How to Qualify?

To qualify for the scheme, the cargo agent must meet the following criteria:

-   The registered business activities with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) are in freight forwarding, logistics or related services
-   Is a Declaring Agent registered with Singapore Customs
-   Have a valid Inter-Bank GIRO maintained with Singapore Customs
-   Have a warehouse located within the Changi Free Trade Zone
-   Handles at least 10 metric tonnes of import air cargoes per month for the past 6 months from the date of application for the CAIA Scheme

## How to Apply?

Cargo agents should complete the [Application for Cargo Agent's Import Authorisation (CAIA)](/eservices/customs-forms-and-service-links) [](/eservices/customs-forms-and-service-links)form and submit via the Networked Trade Platform (NTP) at [www.ntp.gov.sg](https://www.ntp.gov.sg){:target="_blank"} by following the procedures stated in the form.

The one-time registration fee for the CAIA Scheme is $240, which includes two CAIA cards. A $10.50 fee (including Goods and Services Tax) is payable for each additional CAIA card.

## Key Responsibilities

Cargo agents under the CAIA Scheme must:

-   Deliver the cargoes to the final consignee only against an import permit issued by Singapore Customs
-   Submit the Cargo Manifest Declaration to the airline agents via the Air Cargo EDI System (ACES) for cargoes taken delivery of, not later than the 10th day from the flight arrival
-   Submit another Cargo Manifest Declaration for cargoes that are subsequently delivered or still undelivered, re-exported or transhipped, after the 10th day from the flight arrival
