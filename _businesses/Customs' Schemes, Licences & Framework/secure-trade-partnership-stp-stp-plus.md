<h1>Secure Trade Partnership (STP) &amp; STP-Plus</h1>
<h2>What are these?</h2>
<p><strong>Secure Trade Partnership (STP)</strong>
</p>
<p>The STP is a voluntary certification programme consistent with the World
Customs Organisation (WCO) SAFE Framework of Standards to secure and facilitate
global trade.</p>
<p>The programme encourages companies to adopt robust security measures using
a risk-based approach in their trading operations to improve global supply
chain security. By participating in the programme, a company demonstrates
commitment and willingness in keeping the supply chain secure.</p>
<p>This programme is open to all supply chain stakeholders directly involved
in the international movement of goods, including importers, exporters,
manufacturers, freight forwarders, warehouse operators, transporters and
terminal operators. It allows flexibility and customisation of security
measures based on the company’s business model and its role in the international
supply chain.</p>
<p><strong>STP-Plus</strong>
</p>
<p>A company with higher security measures in place will be eligible for
STP-Plus. It will also receive additional facilitation through the Mutual
Recognition Arrangements (MRAs) with our partners.</p>
<p>An MRA is a formal document signed between 2 customs administrations where
both national supply chain security programmes are recognised and accepted
between the signing parties. An MRA with a partner means our security requirements
and validation process of STP is consistent with the partner’s programme.
Hence, the certified status of a STP-Plus company will also be recognised
by the MRA partner.</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>Companies with robust security measures will benefit from increased visibility
of goods in the supply chain, reduction in pilferages and greater efficiency
in their supply chain management.</p>
<p>In addition, STP-Plus certified companies will enjoy these benefits:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced inspection or expedited clearance if its certified status is also
recognised by other partners through a mutual recognition arrangement</p>
</li>

<p>A single point of contact from Singapore Customs will be provided</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
<p><strong>1)</strong>  <strong>What are the requirements to obtain STP or STP-Plus certification?</strong>
</p>
<p>To attain the STP certification, a company has to meet all of the stipulated
requirements in the STP guidelines and criteria. To renew your STP certificate,
STP certified companies are required to:</p>
<p>i) complete the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/stpselfassessmentchecklist" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">STP Self-Assessment Checklist</a>
</p>
<p>ii) obtain the endorsement of an ACRA-listed director; and</p>
<p>iii) submit a <a href="https://go.gov.sg/stpselfdeclaration" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FormSG declaration</a> to
Singapore Customs by the last day of each calendar year (i.e 31 December).</p>
<p>For more information, please refer to the <a href="/files/FAQs_for_Streamlined_STP_renewal_Final_31_Dec_24.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>For the STP-Plus certification, a company must meet all the stipulated
requirements in the STP guidelines and criteria, and achieve the “Premium”
band under the TradeFIRST assessment. The STP-Plus certification will last
for 3 years.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong>  <strong>Can my company submit one STP application to obtain certifications for two different entities? For example, entities with two different Unique Entity Numbers (UENs) although both entities are under the same company group?</strong>
</p>
<p>No. These entities are considered different legal entities and therefore
require separate applications.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong>  <strong>Will my company be certified as STP or STP-Plus automatically if we are already certified with other supply chain security standards (for example, Transported Asset Protection Association (TAPA), ISO 28 000)?</strong>
</p>
<p>No. The scope and objective of other supply chain standards are different
from STP, and hence cannot be a direct substitution. For example, apart
from robust security measures, a company must also have good compliance
records with Singapore Customs and other relevant government authorities
to be certified under the STP programme.</p>
