<h2>Rules of Origin</h2>
<p>Rules of origin (ROO) are defined as the specific provisions applied by
a country to determine the origin of goods and using principles established
by national legislation or international agreements.</p>
<p>For the purposes of Singapore’s <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/files/important%20permit%20fields.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">permit application</a>,
the “Country/Region of Origin” of a good refers to the country/region in
which the goods were wholly obtained or substantially transformed to their
final form.&nbsp; When declaring the “Country/Region of Origin”, the good
must meet the prevailing rules of origin of the country/region where the
goods are produced or manufactured.</p>
<h3>Non-Preferential Rules of Origin</h3>
<p>To qualify as goods of Singapore origin for non-preferential purposes
(i.e. for goods that are not seeking preferential tariff treatment), the
following origin criteria apply:</p>
<p>a) Be wholly obtained (i.e. wholly grown or produced entirely in Singapore);
or</p>
<p>b) Have undergone substantial transformation in Singapore by meeting any
of the following criteria:</p>
<p>i) Manufactured in Singapore with minimum 25% of Local Content based on
the ex- factory price of the finished goods;</p>
<p>ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attained a Change in Tariff Classification
at the 6-digit level (i.e. Change in Tariff Sub-Heading); or</p>
<p>iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Undergone a Chemical Reaction (only for products
under HS Chapters 27 to 40).</p>
<p>Goods which have only undergone minimal processing in Singapore, would
not qualify as Singapore-originating.</p>

more information on Singapore’s non-preferential ROO. They also apply to
the issuance of <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/certificates-of-origin/overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ordinary (non-preferential) Certificates of Origin</a>,
which you may wish to obtain for commercial reasons.</p>
<p>For the purposes of Singapore’s import, export and transhipment permit
applications, the “Country/Region of Origin” of a good refers to the country/region
in which the goods were wholly obtained or substantially transformed to
their final form. To declare “Singapore” as the “Country/Region of Origin”
for goods that are not seeking preferential tariff treatment, the goods
must meet the above criteria. For more resources on permit applications,

<h3>Preferential Rules of Origin</h3>
<p>To qualify as Singapore-originating goods and be eligible for preferential
tariff treatment when goods are exported from Singapore to an FTA partner
country/region, your goods must meet the specific origin criteria set out
in the relevant FTA that is in force. You may use the <a href="https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/grow-your-business/go-global/international-agreements/free-trade-agreements/find-an-fta" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">EnterpriseSG FTA search engine</a> to
