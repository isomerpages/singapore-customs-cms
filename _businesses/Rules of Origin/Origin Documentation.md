<h1>Origin Documentation</h1>
<p>Origin Documentation, also known as proof of origin, helps to attest to
the origin of goods. Broadly, there are two types of origin, namely <strong>non-preferential origin</strong> and <strong>preferential origin</strong>.</p>

<h2>Non-Preferential Origin</h2>
<p>An ordinary Certificate of Origin (CO), also known as a non-preferential
CO, is a trade document that helps to identify the origin of the good.</p>

more information on the rules of origin for ordinary COs.</p>
<ul>

<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<p>You are accountable as an exporter or declaring agent for the export of
your goods. We encourage you to take note of the following Dos and Don’ts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do</p>
<p>✔ Inform Singapore Customs if there is any change in your company’s particulars
to ensure you receive timely updates on regulatory changes.</p>
<p>✔ Know the export procedures and declaration requirements before you export.</p>
<p>✔ Ensure you provide the necessary supporting documents and information
for permit declarations to your declaring agents and freight forwarders.</p>
<p>✔ Ensure your declaring agents and freight forwarders understand and properly
execute your instructions.</p>
<p>✔ Know the contents of each consignment you export and clarify with relevant
parties if needed.</p>
<p>✔ Keep your supporting documents for a minimum of 5 years.</p>
<p>✔ Check with the relevant Competent Authority on their requirements to
export controlled items.</p>
<p>✔ Ensure product details (for example, HS code, quantity) are correctly
declared.</p>
<p>✔ Ensure you comply with all permit conditions stated in the permit.</p>
<p>✔ Ensure your driver or transport service provider produces the permit
for endorsement at the checkpoint if the permit bears such a condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do Not</p>
<p>✖ Deny Singapore Customs officers’ requests to enter your premises or
to check your documents.</p>
<p>✖ Make a declaration without verifying the authenticity of all supporting
documents.</p>
<p>✖ Declare that goods are of Singapore origin when they were only imported
and re-exported from Singapore without qualifying for their origin status.</p>
<p>✖ Share your TradeNet user ID and password with other persons.</p>
<p>✖ Use your company’s UEN to export goods not belonging to you unless you
are involved in taking the goods out of Singapore for export and are willing
to declare yourself as the exporter on behalf of the party that issues
the export invoice, or you are acting as a consolidator for customers without
a UEN. In doing so, you are responsible for complying with all the regulatory
requirements. Please refer to <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/news-and-media/circulars/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Customs Circular No. 13/2021</a> for
more information on the responsibilities of an exporter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Offences</h2>
<p>Companies may be penalised under the Regulation of Imports and Exports
Act (RIEA) if they do not comply with requirements relating to rules of
origin.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of common offences</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Making a false declaration</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Deliberate false declaration of country of origin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Declaring non-Singapore origin materials from local suppliers as Singapore-origin</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorrect trade descriptions</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Affixing false labels of origin on textile goods</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure to retain documents for the minimum retention period</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retaining supporting documents for preferential tariffs claimed under
the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement for 3 years instead of the minimum
5 years</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For minor offences under the RIEA, Singapore Customs may offer to compound
the offences for a sum not exceeding S$5,000 per offence. Offenders may
be prosecuted if the offence committed is of a fraudulent or serious nature.</p>
