# Strategic Goods Control List

Goods and technology that meet the technical specifications described in the Strategic Goods Control List are subject to controls under the Strategic Goods (Control) Act (SGCA).

The Strategic Goods Control List is found in The Schedule to the  [Strategic Goods (Control) Order 2021](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL-Supp/S564-2021/Published/20210802?DocDate=20210802){:target="_blank"}. It includes items from the four multilateral export control regimes – Australia Group, Missile Technology Control Regime, Nuclear Suppliers Group and Wassenaar Arrangement.

The Schedule consists of two parts, each split into two divisions and further sub-divided as follows:
