# Permit and Registration Requirements

A strategic goods permit is required for:

-  Any transfer (export, transhipment, transit, and/ or intangible transfer) of strategic goods and related technology listed in the [Strategic Goods Control List](/businesses/strategic-goods-control/strategic-goods-control-list); and
-   Any transfer (export, transhipment, transit, intangible transfer, and/ or brokering) of goods or technology, which is intended or likely to be used for or in connection with weapons of mass destruction.

## Export, Transhipment, Transit and Intangible Transfer of Technology (ITT)

To provide greater facilitation and promote effective internal export control compliance, Singapore Customs implemented the  **Strategic Trade Scheme (STS)**. The STS applies to all businesses who wish to export, tranship, bring in transit strategic goods and related technology, or transmit strategic goods software or technology.

The permit procedures under the STS consist of:

**Individual Permit**

-   [Individual Permit](/individual-permit-export-transhipment-and-transit){:target="_blank"}  to be applied  _at least 5 working days_  before every  **export, re-export, transhipment or transit of strategic goods**
-   [ITT permit](/businesses/strategic-goods-control/permit-and-registration-requirements/intangible-transfer-of-technology-itt){:target="_blank"}  to be applied  _at least 7 working days_  before the  **transmission of strategic goods software or technology**

**Bulk Permit**

-   Pre-approvals (for a period determined by Singapore Customs) to be applied before the  **[export, re-export, or transhipment](/businesses/strategic-goods-control/permit-and-registration-requirements/bulk-permit-export-transhipment-and-intangible-transfer-of-technology){:target="_blank"}** **of strategic goods**, or the  **[transmission of strategic goods software or technology](/businesses/strategic-goods-control/permit-and-registration-requirements/intangible-transfer-of-technology-itt){:target="_blank"}**.
-   TradeNet permit to be declared before the cargo is lodged with the sea port operators or air cargo ground handling agents, or brought into Singapore for transhipment.

**Note:** The permit application will only be processed after all the required documents have been submitted to Singapore Customs.

For more information on STS, please refer to the [Strategic Trade Scheme Handbook](/files/businesses/seb/STS_Handbook___updated_1_Oct_2024.pdf).

## Brokering

A  **[brokering registration](/businesses/strategic-goods-control/permit-and-registration-requirements/brokering){:target="_blank"}** is to be applied _at least 14 working days_  before the brokering of items and technology listed in the  [Strategic Goods (Control) (Brokering) Order 2019](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/SGCA2002-S534-2019?DocDate=20190801=20190801){:target="_blank"}. A  [brokering permit](/businesses/strategic-goods-control/permit-and-registration-requirements/brokering){:target="_blank"}  is also required under certain circumstances.
