# Sanctioned Lists and Red Flags

## United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Sanctions

As a member of the United Nations, Singapore implements the  [Resolutions](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/resolutions){:target="_blank"}  passed by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) through our domestic laws. These include arms embargoes and sanctions on missiles or nuclear related goods. Activities which contravene the decisions of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) in their Resolutions are prohibited.

Please refer to the  **[United Nations Security Sanctions](/businesses/united-nations-security-council-sanctions/){:target="_blank"}** page for more information.

You are also advised to look out for red flags to ensure your trading activities comply with Singapore’s domestic laws and the UNSC Resolutions. Please note Singapore does not enforce unilateral sanctions imposed by other countries.

## Red Flags

Every member in the trading community plays an important role in ensuring that their goods are not used for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

It is important to know your customer and the end-use application of your product or the strategic goods you are dealing with to ensure your business activities comply with Singapore’s laws and the UNSC Resolutions and do not pose a threat to global security.

Below is a checklist to help you identify potential warning signs to avoid engaging in illegal strategic goods or UNSC prohibited transactions.

**Things to Look Out For**

| **Customer** | **End-use/Product** |
|--|--|
| - You are approached by a customer whose identity is not clear. <br> - The customer has little or no business background. <br> - The customer is usually involved in military related business. <br> - The customer or his address is similar to one of the parties listed in the United Nations Security Council sanctioned entity list. <br> - The customer or purchasing agent is reluctant to offer information about the end-use of the goods. <br> - The customer requests shipment or labelling of goods that are inconsistent with usual shipping and labelling practices. <br> - The customer is unfamiliar with the product's performance characteristics but still wants the product. <br> - The customer declines routine installation, training, or maintenance services. | - Delivery dates are vague, or deliveries are planned for out of the way destinations. <br> - The product's capabilities do not fit the buyer's line of business (for example, an order for sophisticated computers for a small bakery). <br> - When questioned, the buyer is evasive and unclear about whether the product is for domestic use, export, or re-export. <br> - The ordered product is incompatible with the technical level of the country it is being shipped to (for example, semi-conductor manufacturing equipment shipped to a country that has no electronics industry). <br> - The shipping route is abnormal for the product and destination. <br> - The freight forwarding firm is listed as the product's final destination. <br> - Packaging is inconsistent with the stated method of shipment or destination. <br> - Equipment is to be installed in an area under strict security control (for example, an area in, or close to, military facilities, or an area where access is severely restricted), or in a suspicious or unusual location. |

## Unilateral Sanctioned Lists
