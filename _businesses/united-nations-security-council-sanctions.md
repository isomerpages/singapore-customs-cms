# United Nations Security Council Sanctions

The  **United Nations Security Council (UNSC)**  resolutions impose sanctions including prohibitions on activities relating to certain countries, goods and services, and/or entities (persons, companies or organisations).

As a member of the United Nations, Singapore implements the [resolutions adopted by the UNSC](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/resolutions){:target="_blank"}. Specifically, the import into, export from, transhipment and transit through Singapore of certain goods which contravene the UNSC sanctions are prohibited under Regulation 6(1)(b) of the  **Regulation of Imports and Exports Regulations (RIER)**. A comprehensive list of UNSC sanctions can be found on the [UNSC Sanctions Committees website](https://www.un.org/sc/suborg/en/){:target="_blank"}.

For **all non-prohibited goods arriving from or destined for the DPRK**, you are required to apply for the permit **at least 3 working days** before the intended shipment date to or from Singapore. Please refer to the permit requirements for the [import](/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/), [export](/businesses/exporting-goods/export-procedures), [transhipment and transit](/businesses/transhipping-goods/transhipment-procedures) of goods through Singapore.

### Permit Requirements for UNSC Procurement Channel

Although nuclear-related items are prohibited from export or re-export to Iran, UNSC Resolution _2231(2015)_  endorsed the establishment of a dedicated “procurement channel” for the transfer of the nuclear-related items, materials, equipment, goods and technology to Iran. Through this procurement channel, the UNSC will allow certain exports of nuclear-related items to Iran if the UNSC has given their prior in-principle approval. The items which qualify for the procurement channel are:

-   Items listed under _INFCIRC/254/Rev.13/Part 1_; and
-   Items listed under  _INFCIRC/254/Rev.10/Part 2_.

The documents can be accessed on the UNSC website at [https://undocs.org/S/RES/2231(2015)](https://www.undocs.org/S/RES/2231(2015)){:target="_blank"}. The listed items are also controlled under the  **Strategic Goods (Control) Act**, and require a strategic goods permit for the export, re-export, transhipment or transit from or via Singapore. 

To seek the UNSC’s in-principle approval of such  **exports**, you are required to submit a completed form and an end-user certification based on the templates provided by the UNSC to Customs. Customs will inform the UNSC of your request for in-principle approval. As the UNSC would take time to process your application, please submit them  **at least 2 months prior**  to the intended date of exportation.

For  **re-exports**,  **transhipment**, and  **transit** of these items please ensure that approval has been obtained from the UNSC Procurement Channel. Proof of the UNSC Procurement Channel’s approval must be submitted together with your strategic goods permit application for the particular shipment.

The  **export**,  **re-export**,  **transhipment**  or  **transit**  of these items to Iran from Singapore without  **both**  a valid approval from the UNSC  **and**  a strategic goods permit from Singapore is an offence.

### General Permit Requirements

With the exception of goods under the UNSC Procurement Channel, all other goods which are  **imported from, exported, re-exported, in transit or transhipment to Iran**  would require a permit to be applied for **at least 3 working days** before the intended shipment date to or from Singapore. Please refer to the permit requirements for the [import](/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/), [export](/businesses/exporting-goods/export-procedures), [transhipment and transit](/businesses/transhipping-goods/transhipment-procedures) of goods through Singapore.

If your shipment is permitted under the exceptions outlined in the UNSC Resolutions, please also submit supporting documents to show that the shipment falls under the exceptions (e.g. a letter of authorisation issued by a United Nations programme).

Please submit the following supporting documents together with your permit application to Singapore Customs either via TradeNet® or via email to [customs_stgc@customs.gov.sg](mailto:customs_stgc@customs.gov.sg) for our verification:
