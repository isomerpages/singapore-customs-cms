<h1>Voluntary Disclosure Programme</h1>
<p>Under the Voluntary Disclosure Programme (VDP), individuals and companies
are encouraged to voluntarily disclose their declaration errors and omissions.</p>
<p>Disclosure applies to all types of offences under laws and regulations
administered and enforced by Singapore Customs.</p>
<h2>Am I Eligible to Make a Disclosure?</h2>
<p>You are eligible for this programme if your disclosure is:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Complete, with all relevant information submitted and,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submitted before notification or commencement of audit checks and/or investigations
by Singapore Customs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no fixed time period for making a voluntary disclosure.</p>
<p>Please note that your VDP submission will be rejected if the information
provided is inaccurate or if any supporting documents are missing.</p>
<p>Please be informed the following scenarios are not eligible for VDP submission:
<br>a) Failure to produce any of the following permits at checkpoints for
clearance:
<br>i) Transhipment permits (IT, OT, TT, TW or IR prefix permits);
<br>ii) Export and Transhipment permits approved for strategic goods (XO or
XP prefix permits) under <strong><u>STS Tier 1</u></strong>;
<br>iii) Permits under the <strong><u>Approved Premises/Scheme</u></strong> (II
or OO prefix permits); and
