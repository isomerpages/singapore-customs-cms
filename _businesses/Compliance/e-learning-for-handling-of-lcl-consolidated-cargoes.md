# e-Learning for Handling of LCL Consolidated Cargoes

![](/images/bannerforlcl.png)

Singapore Customs observes that some companies handling LCL consolidated cargoes may not be fully aware of the relevant Customs procedures and requirements. This could result in non-compliance issues such as short payment of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on imported goods.

Therefore, Singapore Customs would like to take this opportunity to share on our regulatory requirements. We strongly encourage you to participate in the e-learning session to understand and improve your compliance level with Singapore Customs.
