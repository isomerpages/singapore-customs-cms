# Self-Compliance

Singapore Customs encourages traders to practise good corporate governance and implement robust internal controls, so that they are able to voluntarily comply with the relevant laws and regulations.

Traders who are self-compliant will enjoy smoother business operations. For instance, shipments by compliant traders are subjected to fewer checks. Non-compliance can result in penalties, seizure and forfeiture of goods, reputational damage, suspended import/export/transhipment privileges for repeated non-compliance, and increased monitoring by Singapore Customs. By staying compliant, traders avoid risks and financial exposure, and stand to gain trade facilitation benefits.

## Education & Outreach

Singapore Customs holds regular dialogues with various segments of the trading community to understand their business needs and to keep them updated on regulatory developments. We also conduct outreach to specific traders to assist them in resolving compliance-related issues.

Singapore Customs has appointed Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) and Republic Polytechnic (RP) to provide a suite of specialised courses on customs requirements for the business community. Companies may visit [Nanyang Polytechnic website](https://www.nyp.edu.sg/schools/sbm/lifelong-learning.html?id=other-short-courses){:target="_blank"}
and [Republic Polytechnic website](https://www.rp.edu.sg/ace/course-summary?searchKeyword=customs){:target="_blank"}to register for the courses.
