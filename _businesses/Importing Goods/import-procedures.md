# Import Procedures

All goods imported into Singapore are regulated under the Customs Act, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Act and the Regulation of Imports and Exports Act.

Imported goods are subject to GST and/or duty payment. A customs permit is required to account for the import and tax payment of the goods.

**Dutiable goods**, which incur both GST and duty, are:

-   Intoxicating liquors
    
-   Tobacco products
    
-   Motor vehicles
    
-   Petroleum products
    

Ad valorem or specific duty rates may be applied for dutiable goods.

All other goods are **non-dutiable and incur GST only**. Prevailing GST rate is levied on the [CIF (cost, insurance and freight) value](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports), which includes duties (if it is a dutiable good) and other charges, costs and expenses incidental to the sale and delivery of the goods into Singapore, whether or not shown on the invoice.

Find out more about [duties](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-and-fees/duties-and-dutiable-goods) and [GST](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/goods-and-services-tax-gst).

## Import Requirements

Before the actual importation, the importer is required to obtain a customs permit.

The importer is the party who imports the goods into Singapore:

-   For their own account or use; or
    
-   For the account or use of some other person
    

If an overseas company sold goods to a local company and the commercial invoice indicates the local customer as the consignee, the local customer will be the importer of the goods.

Please see the [types of Customs permits and situations where no customs permit is required](/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/types-of-import-permits) for more information.

Taxable companies should also check with the [Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS)](http://www.iras.gov.sg/)on the arrangements to account for the GST.

## Errors &amp; Offences

Importers may be penalised if they do not comply with the requirements imposed under the Customs Act, the Regulation of Imports and Exports Act (RIEA), and their subsidiary legislation.

<b>Examples of Common Errors and Corrective Actions</b>
<ul class="jekyllcodex_accordion">
<li>
    <input id="accordion1" type="checkbox">
    <label for="accordion1">For errors made in an import permit, please take note of the following:</label>
<div>
	<ul>
				<li><b>Import permit is not utilised</b><br>
					You may submit an <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/permit-amendments-and-cancellation">amendment or cancellation</a> request via TradeNet and specify the reason for amendments (e.g. extend permit validity) or cancellation. Certain permit fields are not amendable if there are controlled, prohibited or dutiable goods involved. Please refer to the <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/files/businesses/psb/tn%20team/annex-b-fields-not-allowed-for-amendment.pdf">list of non-amendable fields</a> for more information. If you are unable to amend or cancel the permit, you may wish to lodge a <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/compliance/voluntary-disclosure-programme">Voluntary Disclosure</a> to Customs. 
If the payment permit cannot be amended or cancelled, you may submit a refund request via TradeNet and specify the reason for refund. There is no need for you to submit a Voluntary Disclosure to Customs.
		</li></ul>
	<ul>
        <li><b>Import permit is utilised</b><br>
Amendments and cancellation are generally not allowed for import permits which have been utilised for clearance. If you have detected any errors in such permits where amendment or cancellation is not allowed, you may wish to lodge a <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/compliance/voluntary-disclosure-programme">Voluntary Disclosure</a> to Customs.</li>
	</ul>
    </div>
	</li>
<li>
	<input id="accordion2" type="checkbox">
    <label for="accordion2">For errors made in a utilised Major Exporter permit, please take note of the following:</label>
<div>
      <ul>
				<li><b>Information wrongly declared on an In-Non-Payment (Approved premises/ schemes) permit by an approved Major Exporter Scheme (MES) trader</b><br>
If the permit was utilised for cargo clearance, the approved MES trader should inform the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) of the correction(s) to be made during the MES trader’s periodic reporting in GST returns to IRAS. The corrections are to be supported by the relevant supporting documents (e.g. commercial invoices and appropriate shipping documents).
				</li></ul>
	<ul>
				<li><b>Wrong importer name and UEN declared</b><br>
The declaring Agent (DA) needs to obtain a replacement In-Non-Payment "Approved Premises/Schemes" (INP-APS) permit with the correct MES trader declared as the importer. Thereafter, the DA should submit a copy of the original permit and replacement permit together with the relevant supporting documents (e.g. commercial invoices and appropriate shipping documents) via <a href="https://go.gov.sg/customs-doc">the Customs Documentation Enquiry Form</a>
					to request for invalidation of the unused replacement permit. Only the importer’s name and UEN should be amended; all other permit fields should remain unchanged.
</li>
				</ul>
    </div>
  </li>
<li>
	<input id="accordion3" type="checkbox">
    <label for="accordion3">For errors made in a utilised In-Payment permit, please take note of the following:</label>
<div>
<ul>
	<li><b>A payment permit was taken up instead of an In-Non-Payment "Approved Premises/Schemes" (INP-APS) permit for a MES trader</b><br>
The In-Non-Payment "Approved Premises/Schemes" (INP-APS) permit should be obtained at the time of importation. A replacement permit is not required as the In-Payment (IPT) permit had been utilised i.e. used for cargo clearance. If you are the DA and had paid the GST, you may approach the importer for the reimbursement of GST paid. The importer can claim the GST paid as input tax in his GST return to IRAS.</li>	
	</ul>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Wrong importer declared in an In-Payment permit</b><br>
For a payment permit with the wrong importer details, a replacement payment permit with the correct importer’s UEN and name must be obtained for the said consignment. Please note that for incorrect foreign values declared, the <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports/customs-exchange-rates">exchange rates</a> to be declared shall be based on the initial permit. The importer or DA may submit a request for <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/refund-of-duties-and-gst">refund</a> of the duty and/or GST paid for the wrong permit via TradeNet and specify the reason for refund.</li></ul>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Wrong value of goods declared in an In-Payment permit</b><br>
A <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/apply-short-payment-permit">short-payment permit application</a> is required to be taken up to account for the short-fall in duty and/or GST paid for goods that had been imported and declared previously. If there is any over-payment or wrong payment of duties and/or GST, the importer or DA may submit a request for <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/refund-of-duties-and-gst">refund</a> of the duty and/or GST paid for the wrong permit via TradeNet and specify the reason for refund.</li></ul>
