# Temporary Import Scheme 
The Temporary Import/Export Scheme (TIS) is designed to allow traders to:

-   Temporarily import goods for approved purposes up to a **maximum of 6 months**, with suspension of Goods and Services Tax (GST) and duty (where applicable), or
    
-   Temporarily export GST and/or duty-paid goods for approved purposes and **re-import the same goods** without GST and duty (where applicable)

## Errors and Offences

Traders may be penalised under the Customs Act if they do not comply with the requirements of the Temporary Import Scheme.

**Examples of non-compliance detected:**

**Incorrect Declarations**

- Application declared for non-qualifying goods (e.g. consumable goods) or non-qualifying purposes (e.g. rental).
- Goods temporarily imported were declared under an incorrect declaration type (e.g. declared under INP(TCR) for repair instead of under INP(TCS) for goods for display at an exhibition).
- Goods temporarily imported under a Customs inward permit for temporary import (e.g. INP[TCR]) were subsequently declared for re-export under an incorrect outward declaration type (e.g. OUT [Direct]), instead of the correct outward declaration type (e.g. OUT [TCR]).
- Goods temporarily imported under a Customs inward permit for temporary import (e.g. INP[TCS]) were subsequently declared for re-export under an incorrect outward declaration for temporary export (i.e. OUT[TCI])), instead of the correct outward declaration type (e.g. OUT [TCS]). 

**Export Without a Customs Outward Permit**

- Failure to obtain a Customs outward permit before the temporary imported goods are re-exported from Singapore.

**Failure to Obtain Approval for Extension to Temporary Import Period**

- Failure to obtain approval for an extension to the temporary import period before the temporary importation end-date.

**Breach of Permit Conditions**

-  Failure to Re-export the Temporarily Imported Goods before the Temporary Importation End-date: DD permit condition states that the “goods must be re-exported by date”.
-  Failure to Re-export the Temporarily Imported Goods Using the Correct Permit: DD permit condition states that the “goods must be exported under a Customs ‘OO’, ‘OU’ or ‘XO’ permit before the stipulated dateline”.
- Failure to Apply for Customs Supervision for Customs Outward Permit Container: D6/D7 permit condition states that an E-file application must be made to Company Compliance &amp; Audit Branch for supervision of stuffing of containers for export or for inspection of the goods.
- Failure to Produce Goods Imported under the Temporary Import Scheme for customs clearance/endorsement at the checkpoints during import and export:
	- Permit and hand-carried goods were not presented at the airport for customs clearance/endorsement.
	- Driver did not produce goods for customs clearance/endorsement at the respective cargo checkpoints.

For minor offences under the Customs Act, Singapore Customs may compound the offences for a sum not exceeding S$5,000 per offence. Offenders may be prosecuted if the offence committed is of a fraudulent or serious nature.

**Penalties upon conviction for key offences**

| Offence | Penalty Upon Conviction |
|---|---|
| Failure to comply with conditions imposed by the Director-General for the removal of dutiable goods from customs control. <br><br> _(Section 27(1)(c) of the Customs Act)_ | A fine not exceeding S$5,000. |
| Making an incorrect declaration. <br><br> _(Section 128(1)(a) of the Customs Act)_ | A fine not exceeding S$10,000, or the equivalent of the customs duty, excise duty or GST payable, whichever is the greater; or imprisonment not exceeding 12 months; or both.|
