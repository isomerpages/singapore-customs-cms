# Temporary Import Scheme 
The Temporary Import/Export Scheme (TIS) is designed to allow traders to:

-   Temporarily import goods for approved purposes up to a **maximum of 6 months**, with suspension of Goods and Services Tax (GST) and duty (where applicable), or
    
-   Temporarily export GST and/or duty-paid goods for approved purposes and **re-import the same goods** without GST and duty (where applicable)

## Errors and Offences

Traders may be penalised under the Customs Act if they do not comply with the requirements of the Temporary Import Scheme.

**Examples of common offences**

- Failure to re-export goods before the temporary importation end-date
-   Failure to request for extension of ATA Carnet before the due date for re-exportation
-   Failure to apply for Customs’ supervision for temporary imported goods
-   Exporting goods in container under a Customs Outward permit (OUT [TCR]) without applying for Customs’ supervision for the stuffing of container
-   Exporting goods under a local ATA Carnet without applying for Customs’ supervision
-   Failure to produce goods under TIS for customs clearance/endorsement
-   Exporting goods under a Customs Outward permit (OUT [TCR]) without producing the goods and permit for endorsement at the checkpoint
-   Exporting goods under the ATA Carnet without producing the goods and the ATA Carnet for endorsement at the checkpoint
-   Failure to obtain Customs Outward permit
-   Exporting goods under an OUT (Direct) permit with permit prefix “OD” instead of the correct Customs Outward permit OUT (TCR) with permit prefix “OO”
-   Making an incorrect declaration
-   Goods were temporarily imported under a Customs Inward permit (In-Non-Payment [TCS]). The same goods were then re-exported using a Customs Outward permit meant for Temporary export/re-import (OUT [TCI]) instead of the correct Customs Outward permit (Out [TCS])

For minor offences under the Customs Act, Singapore Customs may compound the offences for a sum not exceeding S$5,000 per offence. Offenders may be prosecuted if the offence committed is of a fraudulent or serious nature.

**Penalties upon conviction for key offences**

| Offence | Penalty Upon Conviction |
|---|---|
| Failure to comply with conditions imposed by the Director-General for the removal of dutiable goods from customs control. <br><br> _(Section 27(1)(c) of the Customs Act)_ | A fine not exceeding S$5,000. |
| Making an incorrect declaration. <br><br> _(Section 128(1)(a) of the Customs Act)_ | A fine not exceeding S$10,000, or the equivalent of the customs duty, excise duty or GST payable, whichever is the greater; or imprisonment not exceeding 12 months; or both.|
