<h1>Controlled &amp; Prohibited Goods for Import</h1>
<p>Controlled goods require proper authorisation (advance notification, licence
or certificate approval) from <strong>Competent Authorities (CA)</strong> before
they may be imported into Singapore. You are advised to check if the goods

If the item is subject to control, you may check directly with the respective
CAs on their licensing requirements. You may download the list of CAs'
contact information via the HS/CA Product Code Search Engine.</p>
