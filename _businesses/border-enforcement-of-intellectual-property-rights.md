# Quick Guide to Border Enforcement Measures for Trademarks, Copyright, Geographical Indications and Registered Designs

## Seizure on request (Lodgement of Notice)

If you are –

* The owner or licensee of a registered trademark;
* The owner or licensee of a copyright;
* A producer or trader of goods identified by a registered geographical indication, or any association of such producers or traders; or 
* The owner or exclusive licensee of a registered design;

You may give the Director-General of Customs  a written notice requesting the seizure of goods that are expected to be imported or exported, and suspected to infringe the trademark, copyright, geographical indication or registered design in question. You will have to provide sufficient information:

a)  to identify the infringing goods;<br>
b)  to enable the Director-General of Customs to ascertain when and where the goods are expected to be imported or exported; and<br>
c)  to satisfy the Director-General of Customs that the goods are infringing.<br>

Any such notice given to the Director-General of Customs is valid for the day the notice is given and another 59 days afterwards (i.e. for 60 days). Within this period, Singapore Customs will seize the identified goods if they are imported into, or to be exported from, Singapore. Once the goods have been seized, you and the importer or exporter of the goods will be informed of the seizure.

Once informed of the seizure, you will have to commence an action for infringement of the trademark, copyright, geographical indication or registered design, and notify the Director-General of Customs accordingly, within 10 working days after the date specified in the notice of seizure given by the Director-General of Customs. The time limit for initiating infringement action may be extended by a further 10 working days, upon request.


## Ex-officio Seizure
  
Besides seizure on request, Singapore Customs may also seize copies or goods which are reasonably suspected to infringe a registered trademark, a copyright or a registered geographical indication, and that are imported into or to be exported from Singapore. Singapore Customs will inform the owner or exclusive licensee of the copyright or the proprietor or licensee of the registered trademark (“the right holder”), or the registrant of the registered geographical indication, as soon as practicable after the seizure. 

The rights holder (for trademark or copyright), or the registrant, or any producer or trader of goods, or any association of such producers or traders (for geographical indication), may then request the Director-General of Customs to continue to detain the  goods. To do so, they must

a)  Provide written notice to Singapore Customs within 48 hours after the date of the notice of the seizure from Singapore Customs. Singapore Customs will respond with a notice to take action as soon as practicable

b)  Subsequently commence an action for infringement of the trademark, copyright or geographical indication and notify the Director-General of Customs accordingly within 10 working days after the date specified in the notice to take action. 

The time limit for initiating infringement action may be extended by a further 10 working days upon request.
  
## Security Requirements 
  
In addition to the above, the right holder (for trademark or copyright), or the registrant or any producer or trader of goods or any association of such producers or traders (for geographical indication) must provide a security that is sufficient:

a)  To reimburse the Government of Singapore for any liability or reasonable expense it is likely to incur in relation to the seizure, storage and disposal of the  goods; and

b)  To pay such compensation as ordered by the court for loss suffered by the defendant if the infringement action is not taken or is dismissed or discontinued, or if the court decides there was no infringement. 

The security may be given to cover (a) the current shipment only, or (b) the current shipment and any future shipments to be seized by Singapore Customs (an "annual security"). An annual security can cover up to 5 outstanding shipments (i.e. shipments detained by Singapore Customs for which the civil proceedings have not been concluded). If at any time the Director-General of Customs is of the opinion that the security given is insufficient, the person depositing the security shall top up the security accordingly.
