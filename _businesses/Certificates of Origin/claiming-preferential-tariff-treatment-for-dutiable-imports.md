# Claiming Preferential Tariff Treatment for Dutiable Imports

As part of its [Free Trade Agreements](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/grow-your-business/go-global/international-agreements/free-trade-agreements))(FTAs) obligations, Singapore grants preferential tariff treatment by exempting customs duty for the import of originating stout/porter, beer including ale, medicated samsu and other samsu from these [FTA Partners](https://go.gov.sg/ftapartner).

## How do I claim preferential tariff treatment?

Depending on the Free Trade Agreement, you should support your claim with:

-   Preferential Certificate of Origin (CO) issued by the Competent Authority;
-   Self-certification by the exporter, producer or importer; or
-   E-ATIGA Form D reference number for Form Ds transmitted electronically via the ASEAN Single Window from Thailand.

You may refer to the  [Forms for Claiming Preferential Tariff Treatment for Dutiable Imports](https://go.gov.sg/pcoform) in Singapore for more details.

Please obtain the forms issued and/or certified by the relevant parties as stated in the respective Free Trade Agreements and Schemes of Preferences.

## Preferential CO or Self-Certification is available at time of import or when goods are bonded in licensed warehouse

**Step 1: Indicate intention to claim preferential tariff treatment through TradeNet**

Leave the “Customs Duty Rate” field blank and indicate “PRF” in the “Preference Indicator” field when submitting your In-Payment permit via TradeNet.

**Step 2: Submit supporting documents**

Submit the preferential CO or self-certification with the permit, commercial invoice and bill of lading to Singapore Customs within 1 week from the clearance date.

For goods bonded in a **licensed warehouse**:

Submit the preferential CO or self-certification with the commercial invoice and In-Non Payment permit to Singapore Customs. After the documents are processed, declare an In-Payment permit with the “Customs Duty Rate” field left blank and “PRF” indicated in the “Preference Indicator” field.

## Preferential CO or Self-Certification is not available at the time of import or when goods are bonded in licensed warehouse

**Step 1: Indicate intention to claim preferential tariff treatment through TradeNet**

Indicate your intention to claim preferential tariff treatment under the “Remarks” column when submitting your In-Payment permit and make full payment of the customs duty for the goods.

Declare the customs duty in the “Customs Duty Rate” field and leave the “Preference Indicator” blank.

**Step 2: Submission of refund via TradeNet**

Once your preferential CO or self-certification and supporting documents are available, please obtain Customs' endorsement on the documents before you can submit a request for [refund of customs duty](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/refund-of-duties-and-gst) via TradeNet® within 1 year from the date of duty payment.
