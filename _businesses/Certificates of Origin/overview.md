# Certificates of Origin

## What is an ordinary Certificate of Origin?

A Certificate of Origin (CO) helps to attest the origin of goods. There are two types of COs, namely ordinary COs and preferential COs. An ordinary CO, also known as a non-preferential CO, is a trade document that helps to identify the origin of the good.

You may refer to this [handbook](/files/businesses/handbook-on-the-rules-of-origin-for-oco.pdf) for more information on the rules of origin for ordinary COs.

## What is a preferential Certificate of Origin (PCO)?

A preferential CO allows your buyer to pay lower or no customs duty when you export your goods under a [Free Trade Agreement](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/non-financial-assistance/for-singapore-companies/free-trade-agreements/ftas/overview){:target="_blank"} or Schemes of Preferences. To check whether the goods are covered under the Free Trade Agreement or Schemes of Preferences and the preferential tariffs, you may refer to Enterprise Singapore's [Tariff Finder](https://mendel-online.com/#/signup/ESG){:target="_blank"} Tool to assist you.

These handbooks provide more information on the rules of origin for preferential COs issued under Free Trade Agreements and Schemes of Preferences:

- [Handbook on rules of origin for preferential Certificates of Origin](/files/businesses/Handbook_on_ROO_for_PCO_Aug2021(TTSB).pdf)
    
- [Handbook on the rules of origin for Schemes of Preference](/files/businesses/handbookonrooforschemeofpreferencesttsbMar2020.pdf)
    

You may use the [FTA Cost Statement Calculator](/files/businesses/FTACostStatementCalculatorBetaVer30112015.xlsm) for a preliminary assessment of the qualifying value content and/or Change in Tariff Classification status of your manufactured good under a specific Free Trade Agreement, after you have identified the applicable origin criterion(a) for the good under the Agreement.

## Who can issue an Ordinary Certificate of Origin (OCO)?

Ordinary COs are issued by Singapore Customs or any of the following authorised organisations:

-   [Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry](http://www.sccci.org.sg/){:target="_blank"}
    
-   [Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry](http://www.sicci.com/){:target="_blank"}
    
-   [Singapore International Chamber of Commerce](http://www.sicc.com.sg/){:target="_blank"}
    
-   [Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry](http://www.smcci.org.sg/){:target="_blank"}
    
-   [Singapore Manufacturing Federation](http://www.smfederation.org.sg/){:target="_blank"}
    
Apart from Singapore Customs, these authorised organisations do also issue ordinary COs for locally manufactured or processed goods, and goods from other countries which are re-exported from Singapore. However, they do not issue ordinary COs for the export of Singapore-origin textiles and textile goods to the United States of America.

All Preferential COs are issued only by Singapore Customs.

    <input type="checkbox" id="accordion2">
    <label for="accordion2">Do Not</label>
    <div>
      <p>✖ Deny Singapore Customs officers’ requests to enter your premises or to check your documents.</p>
			<p>✖ Make a declaration without verifying the authenticity of all supporting documents.</p>
			<p>✖ Declare that goods are of Singapore origin when they were only imported and re-exported from Singapore without qualifying for their origin status.</p>
			<p>✖ Share your TradeNet user ID and password with other persons.</p>
			<p>✖ Use your company’s UEN to export goods not belonging to you unless you are involved in taking the goods out of Singapore for export and are willing to declare yourself as the exporter on behalf of the party that issues the export invoice, or you are acting as a consolidator for customers without a UEN. In doing so, you are responsible for complying with all the regulatory requirements. Please refer to <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/news-and-media/circulars/">Customs Circular No. 12/2013</a> for more information on the responsibilities of an exporter.</p>
