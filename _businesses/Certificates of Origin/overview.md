# Origin Documentation

Origin Documentation, also known as proof of origin, helps to attest to the origin of goods. Broadly, there are twp types of origin, namely **non-preferential origin** and **preferential origin**.

## Non-Preferential Origin

An ordinary Certificate of Origin (CO), also known as a non-preferential CO, is a trade document that helps to identify the origin of the good.

You may refer to this [handbook](/files/businesses/ttsb-roo/handbook_on_the_rules_of_origin_for_oco__3_.pdf) for more information on the rules of origin for ordinary COs.

## Preferential Origin

A preferential proof of origin allows your buyer to pay lower or no customs duty when you export your goods under a [Free Trade Agreement](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/Grow-Your-Business/go-global/international-agreements/free-trade-agreements/find-an-fta#){:target="_blank"}. You may refer to Enterprise Singapore's [Tariff Finder](https://sg.mendel-online.com/){:target="_blank"} Tool to assist you in the following:

- Whether the goods are covered under Free Trade Agreement and the corresponding preferential tariffs.
- Which Free Trade Agreement is most suitable for your goods.

    </div>
  </li>
		<li>
    <input type="checkbox" id="accordion2">
    <label for="accordion2">Do Not</label>
    <div>
      <p>✖ Deny Singapore Customs officers’ requests to enter your premises or to check your documents.</p>
			<p>✖ Make a declaration without verifying the authenticity of all supporting documents.</p>
			<p>✖ Declare that goods are of Singapore origin when they were only imported and re-exported from Singapore without qualifying for their origin status.</p>
			<p>✖ Share your TradeNet user ID and password with other persons.</p>
			<p>✖ Use your company’s UEN to export goods not belonging to you unless you are involved in taking the goods out of Singapore for export and are willing to declare yourself as the exporter on behalf of the party that issues the export invoice, or you are acting as a consolidator for customers without a UEN. In doing so, you are responsible for complying with all the regulatory requirements. Please refer to <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/news-and-media/circulars/">Customs Circular No. 12/2013</a> for more information on the responsibilities of an exporter.</p>
