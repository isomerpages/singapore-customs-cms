# ASEAN Customs Transit System (ACTS)

The objective of this page is to guide traders on how to participate in the ACTS.

## What is ACTS and who can apply? 

The ASEAN Customs Transit System (ACTS) is a computerised Customs transit management system available to operators who move goods across borders in ASEAN. Requiring only one Customs formality, it facilitates trader by allowing traders to transport goods freely through the participating ASEAN Member States*. A truck can travel from its point of loading to its destination in a different ASEAN country with no need for a different Customs declaration at each border, and no need to transfer the goods to a different truck in each country.  The duties and taxes are covered by a single guarantee for all the countries involved in the transit operation.<br>

<sup>**\*Participating Member States include Cambodia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam.**

## Who can apply?

All traders, which includes importers, exporters, transporters, freight forwarders and Customs agents are eligible to use the ACTS to transport goods across borders.  Traders must be registered as ACTS traders (ATT or non-ATT) with the participating ASEAN Member States*.

Traders who are qualified to be Authorised Transit Traders (ATT) will be given certain privileges that include permission to start transit movements from their own premises at departure, and to deliver to their own premises at destination.

### Additional Information: 

**ASEAN Goods Vehicle Cross-Border Permit (AGVCBP)**<br>
Vehicles that are used to transport goods under the ACTS must each be allocated with the ASEAN Goods Vehicle Cross-Border Permit (AGVCBP). For more information on the AGVCBP and its application procedures, please visit the [AGVCBP webpage](https://acts.asean.org/traders-guide/ASEAN-goods){:target="_blank"}  or contact LTA via the online feedback form: [https://www.lta.gov.sg/feedback/](https://www.lta.gov.sg/feedback/){:target="_blank"}.
