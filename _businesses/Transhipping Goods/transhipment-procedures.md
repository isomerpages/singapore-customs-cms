# Transhipment Procedures

The transhipment and transit of goods through Singapore are regulated under the Customs Act, the Regulation of Imports and Exports Act, the Strategic Goods (Control) Act, and other legislations enforced by the relevant Competent Authorities.

The transhipment of all goods is not subject to duty or Goods and Services Tax (GST).

## Transhipment Requirements

A Transhipment Agent is required to obtain a Customs transhipment permit (where applicable) before the transhipment of goods. The Transhipment Agent is the party who arranges for the transhipment of goods through Singapore and can include a freight forwarder, Non-Vessel Owning Common Carrier (NVOCC) or shipping agent.

## Errors and Offences

Traders may be penalised if they do not comply with the Customs requirements imposed under the Customs Act, the Regulation of Imports and Exports Act (RIEA), the Strategic Goods (Control) Act (SGCA) and their subsidiary legislation.

 **Examples of common offences**

-   Violation of permit conditions
    -   Failure to produce a permit for Customs clearance at the FTZ “In” gate (second checkpoint) for inter-gateway movement

-   Making an incorrect declaration
    -   Incorrectly declaring controlled goods as ship spares, where the controlled goods require prior approval from the relevant Competent Authority

-   Transhipping goods without a permit
    -   Failure to obtain a Transhipment permit with Message Type “Out (with or without CO)” and Declaration Type “Direct (including storage in FTZ) (DRT)” when there is inter-gateway movement between two FTZs

-   Transfer of strategic goods without the correct permits
    -   Transhipping information security equipment, which are controlled under the SGCA, with an Outward Transshipment (“OT”) permit instead of the Strategic Goods Transhipment (“XP”) permit

Singapore Customs may compound the offences for a sum not exceeding S$5,000 per offence for minor offences under the Customs Act and RIEA, and not exceeding S$10,000 per offence for minor offences under SGCA. Offenders may be prosecuted if the offence committed is of a fraudulent or serious nature.

Do take note of the following before transhipping goods through Singapore:

-   Check if the goods you intend to tranship are  [strategic goods](/businesses/strategic-goods-control/overview), [controlled goods, or prohibited goods for transhipment](/businesses/transhipping-goods/controlled-and-prohibited-goods-for-transhipment).

-   The **United Nations Security Council (UNSC)** imposes sanctions that prohibit the importation, exportation, transhipment and transit of certain goods through Singapore to some countries. Please refer to the relevant [UNSC Resolutions](/businesses/united-nations-security-council-sanctions/) for more information.
