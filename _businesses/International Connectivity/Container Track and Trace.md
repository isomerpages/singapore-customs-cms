# About Container Track and Trace Service
The Container Track and Trace service enables users of the Networked Trade Platform (NTP) to see at a glance where their container shipments are. NTP users can see the key milestone events of their container shipment’s journey including customs clearance, load and discharge statuses of their container shipments between Singapore and China. 

This service is available to all NTP users from 1 December 2022. All you need is an NTP account and the container number you wish to track. 

In the current phase, this service is available for shipments between Singapore and Yangshan Port in Shanghai, and Qinzhou Port in Guangxi, China.

This NTP Container Track and Trace service aims to provide supply chain visibility to our Singapore-based traders and their logistics partners. This enables them to improve decision-making to stay competitive. You can simply key in the container number to retrieve the status of a particular container. Vessel events, container events and customs-related information would be shared through the service as listed below.
