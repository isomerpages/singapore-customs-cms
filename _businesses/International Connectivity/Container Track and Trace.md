# About Container Track and Trace Service
The Container Track and Trace service enables Singapore-based traders and their logistics partners to see at a glance where their container shipments are. They can also see the key milestone events of their container shipment’s journey - including customs clearance, load and discharge statuses of their container shipments - between Singapore and China. 

In the current phase, this service is available for shipments between Singapore and Yangshan Port in Shanghai, and Qinzhou Port in Guangxi, China.

This NTP Container Track and Trace service aims to provide supply chain visibility to our Singapore-based traders and their logistics partners. This enables them to improve decision-making to stay competitive. You can simply key in the container number to retrieve the status of a particular container. Vessel events, container events and customs-related information would be shared through the service as listed below.
