## Electronic exchange of the ASEAN Customs Declaration Document (ACDD) under the ASEAN Single Window (ASW)

The ASEAN Single Window (ASW) is a regional initiative that connects and integrates the National Single Windows (NSWs) of ASEAN Member States (AMS), thereby allowing the electronic exchange of data between the AMS. <br> 

The ASEAN Customs Declaration Document (ACDD) is an electronic document to facilitate the exchange of export declaration information between exchange-ready AMS. It contains a specific set of TradeNet export permit data, which will be sent to the Customs authority in the importing exchange-ready AMS for the purpose of supplementing risk management by the Customs authority in the importing country. The expected benefits for participating traders include potential reduction in Customs clearance time for consignments which are supported by the ACDD and imported into exchange-ready AMS. <br>
