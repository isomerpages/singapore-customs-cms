# Networked Trade Platform

The Networked Trade Platform (NTP) is owned and operated by Singapore Customs. The NTP allows you to digitally transact with Singapore Customs as well as other trade regulators in Singapore and abroad. The NTP also connects parties across the global trade value chain to support Singapore’s trade competitiveness. Digitalised, streamlined and automated trade transactions on the NTP will save you and other stakeholders in the trade ecosystem time, effort and money.

Through the NTP, you can:
* 	Digitally transact with Singapore Customs – to submit forms, check statuses and more.
* 	Digitally send and receive regulatory e-documents and data to and from overseas Customs authorities and other regulators.

Visit the [NTP](http://www.ntp.gov.sg/) for more information.
