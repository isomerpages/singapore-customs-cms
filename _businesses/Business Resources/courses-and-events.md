# Courses for Businesses

Singapore Customs has appointed Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) and Republic Polytechnic (RP) to provide a suite of specialised courses on customs requirements for the business community. This training collaboration seeks to meet the industry’s demands for more frequent courses while enhancing the effectiveness of adult learning.
