# Enforcement

Singapore Customs conducts regular checks on activities carried out by traders to ensure legitimate transfers of strategic goods and strategic goods technology.

Documentary checks and audits are conducted on past shipments. Customs officers also conduct physical examination of suspicious shipments at entry and exit points and within free trade zones.

Enforcement action is carried out based on specific intelligence and risk profiling. Singapore works closely with foreign governments to share intelligence and exchange information on strategic goods offences, in a manner consistent with our respective laws. Customs takes a serious view of strategic goods offences and will not hesitate to take enforcement actions.

You are reminded to exercise due diligence if you are involved in activities relating to the transfer or brokering of strategic goods or strategic goods technology. To ensure compliance with the Strategic Goods (Control) Act (SGCA) and its subsidiary legislations, you are advised to implement an internal compliance programme as outlined in the  [Strategic Trade Scheme Handbook](/files/businesses/seb/sts%20handbook%20-%201%20oct%202023.pdf).

Members of the public with information on illegal dealings in strategic goods and technology may [report to Singapore Customs](https://www.customs.gov.sg/news-and-media/advisories/permalink/).
