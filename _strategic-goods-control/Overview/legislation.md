# Legislation

Singapore’s regulatory controls on strategic goods are based on the Strategic Goods (Control) Act and its subsidiary legislation.

**Strategic Goods (Control) Act**

The  [Strategic Goods (Control) Act (SGCA)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/SGCA2002){:target="_blank"}  regulates the export, transhipment, transit, intangible transfer of technology and brokering of strategic goods and strategic goods technology. It prescribes a “catch-all” provision where all goods or technology intended or likely to be used for weapons of mass destruction purposes will be subject to controls.

## Subsidiary Legislation

**Strategic Goods (Control) Regulations**

The  [Strategic Goods (Control) Regulations (SGCR)](https://assets.egazette.gov.sg/2025/Legislative%20Supplements/Subsidiary%20Legislation%20Supplement/661.pdf){:target="_blank"}  spell out the procedural guidelines to support the implementation of the SGCA – including facilitative permit procedures for legitimate activities and the conditions for approval, revocation, or suspension of the permits.

**Strategic Goods (Control) Order**

Singapore has updated its list of strategic goods and strategic goods technology in the [Strategic Goods (Control) Order 2025](https://assets.egazette.gov.sg/2025/Legislative%20Supplements/Subsidiary%20Legislation%20Supplement/660.pdf){:target="_blank"}, effective from 1 December 2025.
