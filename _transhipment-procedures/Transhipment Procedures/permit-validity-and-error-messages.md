Generally, the validity periods for the different types of transhipment permits are as follow:

|Transhipment / Movement Permit (Message Type)  | Validity Period* |
|--|--|
| Transhipment / Movement |  Approval date + 21 working days for goods covered by Through Bill of Lading or Airway Bill<br><Br>  Approval date + 22 working days for strategic goods covered by Through Bill of Lading or Airway Bill |
  
<sup>*Note: Please refer to the specific validity periods for each permit. If you are unable to utilise the permit within the stipulated period, please [extend the validity period](/businesses/transhipping-goods/transhipment-procedures/permit-amendments-and-cancellation)  of the permit via TradeNet before it expires.
