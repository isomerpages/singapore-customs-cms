# Types of Transhipment/Movement Permits

A transhipment permit is required to account for the following transhipment movements:

-   For goods (all types) that are transhipped from one Free Trade Zone (FTZ) to another FTZ, a  **Transhipment (Through Transhipment with Inter-Gateway Movement (TTI)) permit**  is required.
-   For goods (all types) that are transhipped from one FTZ to land checkpoint (and vice versa), a Transhipment (Through Transhipment with Inter-Gateway Movement (TTI)) permit is required.
-   For controlled goods transhipped within the same FTZ, a  **Transhipment (Through Transhipment within the same FTZ (TTF)) permit**  is required.
