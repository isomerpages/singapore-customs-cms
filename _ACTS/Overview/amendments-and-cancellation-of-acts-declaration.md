## Amendment of ACTS Declaration
After an ACTS declaration has been accepted (i.e. ACTS Reference Number allocated) in the ACTS, you may amend the declaration before it is released for transit. There is no limit to the number of times the declaration is amended and all declaration details except for the Principal TIN and the Customs Office of Departure may be amended.

## Cancellation of ACTS Declaration 
After an ACTS declaration has been accepted (i.e. ACTS Reference Number allocated) in the ACTS, you are allowed to submit a request for cancellation of the declaration before it is released for transit.

You should cancel an ACTS declaration if it is not utilised for transit movement due to reasons such as but not limiting to:
  - Cancellation of shipment; and 
  - TAD could not be printed / used etc.
