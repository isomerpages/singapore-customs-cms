# IPMs Imported by Posts

No Customs permit is required if the IPMs are imported by [parcel post](/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/importing-by-post-or-courier-service). However, GST is payable for non-IPMs if the goodsâ€™ [CIF value](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports) exceed S$400.
