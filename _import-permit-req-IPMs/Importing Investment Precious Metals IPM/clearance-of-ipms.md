# Clearance Of IPMs

During cargo clearance, the relevant import permit (if required) and supporting documents (for example, commercial invoice, packing list, Bill of Lading/Airway Bill) must be produced to the checkpoint officers for verification.
    
For hand-carried IPMs, you may proceed to the Customs Red Channel at the arrival hall after immigration clearance, and inform the checkpoint officer of the IPMs carried. You are required to produce the supporting documents (for example, Customs import permit (if applicable), commercial invoice(s), certificates, etc) to the checkpoint officers for verification.
