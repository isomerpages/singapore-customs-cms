# Approved Refiner and Consolidator Scheme

The Approved Refiner and Consolidator Scheme (ARCS), administered by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS), is designed to ease cash flow and compliance of qualifying refiners and consolidators of IPMs in their payment of GST on import and purchase of raw materials and relieve input tax incurred on refining activities.

More information on ARCS can be found  [here](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Schemes/GST/Approved-Refiner-and-Consolidator-Scheme--ARCS-/){:target="_blank"}.
