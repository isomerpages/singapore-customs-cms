# IPMs Imported by Air/Sea Freight or by Land

Import of IPMs by **air freight**, of a **total [Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) value](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/establishing-customs-value-for-imports)** **not exceeding** **S$400**, do not require a Customs permit**.**

Import of IPMs by **air freight**, of a **total CIF value exceeding S$400**, requires an In-Non Payment (GST Relief) permit.

Import of IPMs by **other freight modes such as by sea or land**, requires an In-Non Payment (GST Relief) permit, **regardless** of the CIF value of the IPMs.

The following should be declared in the [In-Non Payment (GST Relief) permit](/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/types-of-import-permits) application:

-   Place of Receipt Code=IGPM
-   Claimant UEN=Importer UEN
-   Relevant Harmonized System (HS) code/s of the IPMs
-   Supplier name to be indicated with the name of refiner who produced the IPM bar/wafer/ingot
-   Brand name to be indicated with the name of the IPM qualifying coin
-   CA/SC Product Code to be indicated as one of the following: “BAR”, “INGOT”, “WAFER”; or “GOLDCOIN”, “SILVERCOIN”, “PLATINUMCOIN”
-   CA/SC Product Code Quantity/UOM should be declared as “xxx NMB”
-   CA/SC Code 1 to be indicated with the value of purity content of the respective precious metals contained in the IPM bars/ingots/wafers/coins. There is no need to indicate the unit of measurement (%). For example, a purity content of 99.8% should be declared as 99.8.

The GST relief permit must be obtained before **the importation of IPMs** and presented at the checkpoint for clearance.

However, if the IPMs are imported as [**trade samples**](/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/importing-trade-samples) and its CIF value is below or equivalent to S$400, GST relief is granted and no permit is required for importation.
