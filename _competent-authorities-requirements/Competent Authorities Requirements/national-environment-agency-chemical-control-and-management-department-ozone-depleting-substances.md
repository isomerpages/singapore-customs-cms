# National Environment Agency - Chemical Control and Management Department (Ozone Depleting Substances)

The import and export of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) are subject to control by the Chemical Control and Management Department (CCMD). With effect from 1 Jan 2019, CCMD has also implemented licensing control for 18 types of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) (inclusive of blends and mixtures). You are required to obtain a Hazardous Substances Licence for the import and/ or export of ODS/HFC listed under the Environmental Protection and Management Act (EPMA). 

The import and/ or export of controlled ODS are not allowed with non-parties to the Montreal Protocol as stipulated under the Environmental Protection and Management (ODS) Regulations. The status of ratification of countries to the Montreal Protocol and its amendments may be viewed at  [https://ozone.unep.org/all-ratifications](https://ozone.unep.org/all-ratifications){:target="_blank"}.

For more information on the control of ODS/HFC in Singapore, please visit [NEA](https://www.nea.gov.sg/corporate-functions/resources/legislation-international-law/multilateral-environmental-agreements/chemical-safety/montreal-protocol) website.
