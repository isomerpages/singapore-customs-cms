# National Parks Board (Plant Health)

1) The National Parks Board (NParks), Horticulture and Community Gardening Division, Plant Science and Health Branch, Plant Health Section (PHU) regulates the importation of plants and plant materials.

2) Plants and plant materials include live plants, cuttings, foliage, cut flowers, vegetable seeds, organic (plant-based) fertilisers, potting media (e.g., soil, peat moss, sphagnum moss, coco husk etc.)

Endangered plants and live insects of agricultural importance are species defined under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

Importers are required to provide all relevant information to NParks for approval before the importation of plant-based organic fertilisers, live insects and microorganisms are carried out.

3) Please follow the following procedures before importing plants or regulated materials:

-   Find out the import health requirements for the plants or plant products that you wish to import. The requirements are in accordance with the Control of Plants (Plant Importation) (Amendment) Rules 2005 and the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act 1989.
