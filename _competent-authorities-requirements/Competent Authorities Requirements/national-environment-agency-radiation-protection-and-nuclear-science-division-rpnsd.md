# National Environment Agency - Radiation Protection and Nuclear Science Division (RPNSD)

A customs permit must be obtained through TradeNet before the goods arrive in/depart from Singapore. 


## Controlled items classified under RPNSD Controlled HS codes

Before you prepare the import/export permit application for controlled items under the purview of RPNSD, please note that the importer/exporter must have either a Dealer Licence (N1, L1 or L2) or a Possession Licence (N2, L3 or L4) issued by RPNSD. In the case of irradiating apparatus covered by Possession Licence (i.e. N2 or L3), each irradiating apparatus must have its individual Possession Licence.

Auto-approval of permit application on TradeNet will only be given to an importer or exporter with a valid Dealer Licence and the Establishment Code (or Product Code) of the item.

To obtain auto-approval on TradeNet, please ensure that the following information is provided in the respective fields before you submit the permit application:

-   Name and Entity Identifier Number of the importer or exporter
    
-   Dealer Licence number of the importer or exporter is to be entered at Licence No. Field
    
-   HS Code (please check with Singapore Customs’ helpdesk to verify or obtain the HS Code)
    
-   RPNSD Establishment Code (or Product Code) to be entered at the CA/SC Product Code field. (Please ensure that the code provided on the invoice aligns with the code on the Dealer’s Licence (eg. N1, L1 or L2). Alternatively, you may lease refer to the “Import or Export of New Items control by RPNSD”)
    
-   CA/SC Product Code
    
-   CA/SC Product Code Quantity and Unit
    

Do not use default or generic item descriptions when declaring information for permit application. Please use the exact descriptions provided on the invoice.

## Non-Controlled items classified under RPNSD Controlled HS code

These refer to items classified under a controlled HS code marked with “*” in Appendix C.  
  
If the item is a non-controlled item (eg. industrial vacuum cleaner) but is classified under a controlled HS code administered by RPNSD (e.g. 84798939), you must declare MISC in the “CA/SC Product Code” field for your permit application to be auto-processed on TradeNet without routing to RPNSD. Do not declare the Establishment Code (or Product Code) and Licence Number if the item is not controlled or licensed by RPNSD.

However, if the item is controlled by RPNSD (e.g. ultrasonic cleaning apparatus), then you must declare the RPSND Establishment Code (or Product Code) in the CA/SC Product Code field as explained in the earlier paragraphs.

Please refer to  [Appendix C](/files/about-us/appendix-c-items-under-import-export-control.pdf) is the list of RPNSD controlled products and their HS codes for import and export.

## Import/Export of Spare Parts (excluding X-ray tubes)

For the import/export of spare parts of a radiation (irradiating) equipment which do not include the source of radiation or the x-ray tube, please declare RADSPARE at both the Licence Number and Product Code fields.

## Import of New Items control by RPNSD

A written request by the importer/exporter, together with the relevant documents is required to be submitted to RPNSD for the inclusion of new radioactive materials or new irradiating apparatus into a Dealer Licence so that a new Product Code can be generated for TradeNet auto-processing. Please inform RPNSD at least ten working days in advance to prevent any delay of approval.

## Import/Export items controlled by RPNSD and other competent authority

In the event that the items to be imported or exported are controlled by RPNSD and other competent authorities, (e.g. medical irradiating apparatus, which is also controlled by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA)), the importer or exporter must consult and seek approval(s) from other competent authorities before proceeding with the import or export.

The importer or exporter has to ensure that the imported or exported items comply with all applicable regulatory requirements stated by the regulatory bodies in Singapore.
