# National Environment Agency - Chemical Control and Management Department (Hazardous Substances)

Before submission of import/export permit application to TradeNet for auto-processing, the Declarant needs to verify whether the items under CCMD-controlled HS Codes contains any ingredients which are listed in Part I of the Second Schedule of the Environmental Protection and Management Act (EPMA). If so, the importer/exporter must possess a valid Hazardous Substances Licence from NEA. The Declarant must declare the Hazardous Substances Licence Number under the 'Licence Number' field. For more information on the list of controlled hazardous substances and control of hazardous substances in Singapore, please visit  [NEA website](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/pollution-control/chemical-safety/hazardous-substances){:target="_blank"}.

For the permit application to be processed smoothly, the declarant is advised to take note of the following:

1.  Determine the appropriate Product Code  
    
    Sort out the import/export items having HS codes that are controlled by CCMD. Then check the detailed chemical composition of these items to look out for ingredients that are listed in the Part I of the Second Schedule of the EPMA. Items having such chemical ingredients controlled under the EPMA are to be declared using a CCMD product code.
    
    For example:
       
    The composition of your product is :
    
    Emulsifiers 30%
    
    Xylene 15%
       
	  Fenthion 55%
    
    In this example, Fenthion is controlled under the EPMA and the product code to be declared is PCDFEN115. The Declarant is also required to provide the product code quantity and its unit of quantity in KGM.
    
    In addition, the Declarant needs to declare the composition of Fenthion, i.e. 55, in the "CA/SC Code1" field found at the item level of the Import/Export Permit application. The Declarant does not need to declare the percentage sign (i.e. %) in the "CA/SC Code1" field.
    
    The list of HS codes and Product codes for CCMD controlled items can be downloaded from the [HS/CA Product Code Search Engine](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/portlets/search/searchHSCA/searchInitHSCA.do) (click on "All HS/CA Product Code" under the download tab).
    
2.  Declare the Maximum Quantity Per Trip  
    
    For controlled hazardous substances found in the Environmental Protection and Management (Hazardous Substances) Regulations [EPM(HS) Reg], the Declarant is required to declare the maximum quantity of hazardous substances chemicals to be transported per trip (computed in "KGM") in the "CA/SC Code2" field found at the "item" level in the Import Permit application. It is not necessary to key in the unit of quantity "KGM" in the "CA/SC Code2" field. For quantities per trip exceeding the limits in The Schedule of the EPM(HS) Reg, the importer or exporter is required to have a transport approval from CCMD for the permit application to be processed smoothly.
    
    Example:
    
    If the maximum quantity per trip is 1 TNE, the Declarant is required to key in "1000" for 1000 kilograms in the "CA/SC Code2" field.
    
3.  Comply with the messages from TradeNet  
    
    The Declarant is required to email the requested documents to CCMD for verification only when prompted by TradeNet.
    

Note:

1.  A customs permit must be obtained through TradeNet before the goods arrive in/depart from Singapore.
2.  The list of chemicals controlled by CCMD and the corresponding exclusions can be found in the Part I of the Second Schedule of the Environmental Protection And Management Act (EPMA). General Exemptions can be found in Part II of the same Schedule. Both the EPMA and its Regulations can be found on the NEA or AGC website.
3.  If importers or exporters do not have the required Hazardous Substances Licence, please contact Development Control and Licensing Division (DCLD) by filling in the [online feedback form](https://www.nea.gov.sg/corporate-functions/feedback)Â and/or calling NEA hotline at 6225 5632 for advice.
4. Permit applications are processed within five working days upon receipt of all required documents. Declarants are encouraged to submit their applications early and ensure all submissions in TradeNet (including supporting documents) are complete and accurate to avoid delays. Permit applications are considered complete when the trader has a valid Hazardous Substance licence and/or Hazardous Substance Transport Approval and all relevant supporting documents are provided.
