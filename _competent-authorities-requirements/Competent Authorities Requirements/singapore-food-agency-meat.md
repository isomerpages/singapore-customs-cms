# Singapore Food Agency (Meat)

The Singapore Food Agency (SFA), Licensing and Permits Group, Food Trade Department regulates the import, export and transhipment of meat and meat products and salted or preserved eggs and processed egg products. Meat and meat products may be imported, exported or transhipped in frozen, chilled, processed or canned form. A customs permit must be obtained through TradeNet before the goods arrive in/depart from/tranship at Singapore.

Please follow the import requirements below for meat and meat products:

-   Traders have to apply for the SFA Licence for the import, export, and transhipment of meat products and fish products. You may refer to the [SFA website](http://www.sfa.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"} for more information.
-   Traders are restricted to importing meat and meat products from SFA approved sources. You may refer to the [SFA website](http://www.sfa.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"} for the list of countries and establishments that have been approved to export meat to Singapore.
-   Each consignment has to be accompanied by an import permit issued by SFA (Meat) and a veterinary health certificate issued by the competent authority of the exporting country to certify that Singaporeâ€™s animal health and food safety requirements have been complied with. Traders are restricted to importing salted or preserved eggs and processed egg products from SFA-approved establishments, with an accompanying health certificate.
-   An import permit issued by SFA (Meat) is required for every consignment of meat product. Traders may apply for the import permit by declaring the import via the TradeNet system. The system will route the application to SFA (Meat) for processing. Upon approval, the import permit for the consignment would be incorporated into the Cargo Clearance Permit (CCP), to be printed at the trader's terminal. When preparing the import, export or transhipment permit application, please declare the following:
    -   SFA (Meat and Fish) licence number in the Licence/Certificate No. field. The registration number for processed food products and food appliances must be keyed in for processed egg products and salted or preserved eggs.
    -   All relevant product information in the:
        -   CA/SC Product Code field (e.g., MCF002 for Chicken Breast, Bone-In, Frozen)
        -   CA/SC Product Quantity field, i.e. Nett quantity at item level, (e.g., 10.00)
        -   CA/SC Product Unit of Quantity field (e.g., TNE)
        -   CA/SC Code 1 field, i.e. Establishment Code (consisting of country code and processing plant number)
        -   CA/SC Code 2 field, i.e. Health Certificate number

You may refer to the [SFA website](http://www.sfa.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"} for the list of product codes for meat and meat products.

Upon submission of the permit application via TradeNet, please attach a copy of the health certificate, together with other supporting documents, (e.g., Bill of Lading, invoice, sales contract, etc.) in your permit application on TradeNet.

Upon approval, please print the CCP for clearance purposes. Please comply with all conditions as stated in the CCP. The original health certificates have to be submitted to the SFA inspectors during the inspection of the imported consignment.

Fees for permits to import, export or tranship meat products, salted or preserved eggs, and processed egg products will be deducted through Inter-Bank GIRO.

Meat and meat products may be exported from Singapore or transhipped within the Free Trade Zone. You are required to produce an export or transhipment permit for each consignment that has been scheduled to be exported or transhipped. The procedure to apply for an export or transhipment permit is similar to the application procedure of an import permit.
