A customs import permit must be obtained through TradeNet before the goods arrive in Singapore. When preparing the import permit applications, please take note of the following:

-   Declare the correct HS Code and the corresponding Product Code for the respective type of product (e.g. comics, books, audio materials etc.) and type of consignment (e.g. exempted categories, non-exempted categories, offshore, languages etc.). Please refer to the [HS/CA Product Code Search Engine](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/portlets/search/searchHSCA/searchInitHSCA.do){:target="blank"} for the list of HS Codes and Product Codes.

-   Provide under the "CA/SC Product Quantity" field the number of titles imported based on the invoices submitted.

-   Indicate "NMB" under the "CA/SC Product Quantity Unit" field.

-   For permit applications submitted to import Malaysian newspapers and periodicals, offshore newspapers as well as publications published in Singapore but printed outside Singapore and Malaysia, enter the numeric portion of the MCI permit number in the “CA Licence No.” field. For example, if the MCI permit number is “MCIP999012004”, declaring agents and traders should enter “999012004” in the “CA Licence No.” field.

-   Relevant supporting documents should be attached and submitted together with the permit application.
