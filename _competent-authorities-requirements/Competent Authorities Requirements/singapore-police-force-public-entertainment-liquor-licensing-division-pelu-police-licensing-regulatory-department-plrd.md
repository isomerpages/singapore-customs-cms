# Singapore Police Force - Public Entertainment & Liquor Licensing Division (PELLD) - Police Regulatory Department (PRD)

Police Regulatory Department (PRD) regulates the importation and use of amusement game machines in Singapore. Before an amusement game machine is imported into Singapore, an approval to import and operate such machines is required. Importers of the game machines are required to submit their applications to PRD for approval at least six weeks before the arrival of the goods in Singapore. The application must be supported with as much information about the item as possible e.g. brochures (in English) with pictures of game machines and describing the objectives and modes of play. PRD will assess the application and will inform the importer / applicant of the result. Such application is to be submitted to PRD via spf_licensing_feedback@spf.gov.sg. A customs permit must also be obtained through TradeNet before the goods arrive in Singapore.

Operators of such game machines will have to obtain a separate public entertainment licence from PRD to allow public to access such games. The operators can apply for Public Entertainment licence online via [GoBusiness Licensing webpage](http://licence1.business.gov.sg/).
