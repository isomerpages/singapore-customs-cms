# National Parks Board (CITES)

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is an international agreement to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. Singapore is one of the parties bounded by CITES to regulate trade in CITES specimens by issuing CITES permits before the shipments enter or leave the country.

You are required to obtain a CITES permit from NParks if you intend to import, export, or re-export CITES specimens for both commercial consignments and personal effects. You must obtain the CITES permit from NParks before the shipment’s arrival and departure dates.

A shipment that is in transit/transhipment before being consigned to a local consignee or importer is considered an import for re-export. You have to apply for a CITES import permit or a CITES re-export permit from NParks if you intend to import the shipment or re-export the shipment.

A customs permit must be obtained through TradeNet before the goods arrive in/depart from Singapore. Please fill in all relevant information when applying for TradeNet Import or Export Permit.  

In the Description of Goods field, please indicate the following:  

-   Singapore CITES permit number (applicable to CITES-listed species)
-   Common name
-   Scientific name
