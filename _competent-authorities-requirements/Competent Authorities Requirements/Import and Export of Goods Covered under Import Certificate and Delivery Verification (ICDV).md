# Import and Export of Goods Covered under Import Certificate and Delivery Verification (ICDV)

The [Import Certificate and Delivery Verification (ICDV)](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/strategic-goods-control/import-certificate-and-delivery-verification) or more commonly known as the International Import Certificate (IIC) serves as an assurance to the supplying or exporting country to complement their export control regime, regardless whether the items are controlled under the Strategic Goods (Control) Act (SGCA).

The ICDV, implemented since 1955 legislated under Regulation of Imports and Exports Regulations (RIER), helps address exporting countriesâ€™ concerns that their sensitive exports to Singapore are destined for the specific end-user in Singapore, and are not diverted to a third country. For re-export, the goods will be re-exported to the end-user or destination approved by the supplying country as specified in the ICDV.

ICDV is a 3-stage process. First, the importer has to submit an application for an [Import Certificate](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/strategic-goods-control/import-certificate-and-delivery-verification/import-certificate). Next, he has to obtain an import permit via  [TradeNet](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/login.portal){:target="_blank"} before the goods arrive in Singapore. Upon importation, he can obtain a [Delivery Verification](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/strategic-goods-control/import-certificate-and-delivery-verification/delivery-verification) from Singapore Customs, if such verification is required by the supplying country.
