The submission of supporting documents via fax or email is not accepted.

For HS codes controlled by GEWD, the Product Codes have to be declared with the Product Code Quantity and Unit, which should align with the declared HS Unit of Quantity.

The list of GEWD regulated Harmonised System Codes and Product Codes can be found  [here](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/portlets/search/searchHSCA/searchInitHSCA.do){:target="_blank"}.

When you are importing, exporting or transhipping non-controlled goods which are classified under GEWD’s controlled HS codes, you shall declare the product code as “MISC” for these HS codes.

The permit application submitted for GEWD controlled items may be combined with the following types of HS codes:

-   other CA controlled HS codes declared with Product code "MISC".

In addition to the GEWD product codes, you are also required to declare the Dealer Licence Number issued by GEWD in the "Licence Number" field of your permit application.

If the Dealer Licence is for your company, you are required to specify the "Arms Dealer Licence" and/or "Explosive Dealer Licence" in the "Licence Number" field.

## On-line processing of Permit Applications

All permit applications containing GEWD controlled items will be routed to GEWD for online processing. To facilitate the processing of your permit applications, you are required to upload the relevant abovementioned documents together with your permit applications for submission via TradeNet.

GEWD will process all declarations in the order they are received in TradeNet and is unable to expedite processing upon a trader's request. Traders are encouraged to submit their permit applications early (at least five working days before the intended import, export or transhipment date) to avoid delays in the permit approval.

After submitting the permit application, the declarant shall track and check the status of his/her permit application on TradeNet. Please do not contact GEWD to check on the status of application.

If the declarant receives queries from GEWD, he shall answer the queries promptly to avoid delay in the permit approval. Generally, GEWD will process all permit applications within five working days.

For the export of arms, explosives or explosive precursors, a customs permit must be obtained through TradeNet before the goods depart from Singapore. GEWD will not approve the permit application of any controlled goods that have departed Singapore. Investigation will be carried out against the exporter for all exportation cases of GEWD’s controlled goods that were conducted without prior approval and export licence.

## Approval Messages

Once the import, export or transhipment permit application is approved, the importer or exporter is required to comply with all the requirements and conditions stated in the approval message(s).
