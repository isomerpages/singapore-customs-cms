# Land Transport Authority (LTA)

Import Control Regime for PABs and Motorised PMDs

Under the Small Motorised Vehicles (Safety) Act 2020 (SMVA), all importers of Power-Assisted Bicycles (PABs) and motorised Personal Mobility Devices (PMDs) are required to obtain approval from the Land Transport Authority (LTA) before importing these devices into Singapore. This applies to devices imported under Harmonised System (HS) codes 87116091 and 87116092.

The import control regime also applies to individuals bringing in PABs or motorised PMDs for personal use (e.g. residents returning to Singapore or travellers entering Singapore).

To import PABs and/or motorised PMDs, importers must apply for an import permit and pay the permit fee via TradeNet. Importers will need to provide the appropriate HS codes, Product codes, and CA/SC codes (where applicable) in the import permit application, and provide all necessary supporting documents.

In general, LTA will only grant import approval for compliant PABs and motorised PMDs. For non-compliant devices, LTA may grant import approval under specific circumstances and subject to LTA’s strict assessment.
