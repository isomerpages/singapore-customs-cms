## Importation of Food Products Containing Poppy Seeds

Poppy seeds are classified as  a controlled import under the Regulation of Imports and Exports Regulations, with the Director, CNB (‘the Director’) as the competent authority regulating the import of this item. This means that an approval is required from the Director for the import into Singapore of poppy seeds.

Any company or person who wishes to import poppy seeds or any food products that contain poppy seeds or both (regardless of the amount or purpose) must submit the Inward Declaration Form (download) together with a certificate from the exporting country or the country of origin of the poppy seeds.

You must send a sample of the seeds or food product or both to the Health Sciences Authority (‘HSA’) located at 11 Outram Road, Singapore 169078 for analysis. 

* If the sample is in the form of seeds, it is to be sent to the Division Director, Illicit Drugs Division, Applied Sciences Group, Health Sciences Authority (HSA). 
 
* If the sample is in the form of food products, it is to be sent to the Division Director, Analytical Toxicology Division (ATL-CFT), Applied Sciences Group, HSA. 

Your application to the CNB will be pending the submission of the HSA report. Once you have received the report, please forward it to CNB so that your application can be reviewed. If HSA certifies that the poppy seeds or food products containing poppy seeds are cleared of any controlled drugs, e.g. no traces of morphine detected, CNB will endorse and approve the Inward Declaration Form. With the endorsement by CNB, the poppy seeds or food products containing poppy seeds will be allowed for import into Singapore. If the poppy seeds or food products containing poppy seeds are found to contain any controlled drug, the import application will be rejected.
