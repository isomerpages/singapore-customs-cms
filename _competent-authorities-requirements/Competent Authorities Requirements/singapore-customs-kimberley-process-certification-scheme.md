# Singapore Customs - Kimberley Process Certification Scheme

The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) is an international scheme to stop the trade of ”conflict diamonds” and to ensure that diamond purchases were not financing violence by rebel movements and their allies seeking to undermine legitimate governments. Singapore has been a Kimberley Process (KP)  [participant](/news-and-media/circulars/2004-03-31-Circular072004.pdf)  since 2004.
