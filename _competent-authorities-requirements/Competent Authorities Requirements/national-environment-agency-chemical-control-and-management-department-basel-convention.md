# National Environment Agency - Chemical Control and Management Department (Basel Convention)

## Hazardous Wastes under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal

The import, export and transit of Hazardous Wastes are subject to control by the Chemical Control and Management Department (CCMD). Under the Hazardous Waste (Control of Export, Import and Transit) Act and its Regulations, any person who wish to export, import or transit hazardous waste must obtain a Basel permit from CCMD. For more information on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes in Singapore, please visit [CCMD website](https://www.nea.gov.sg/corporate-functions/resources/legislation-international-law/multilateral-environmental-agreements/chemical-safety/basel-convention){:target="_blank"}.

CCMD adopts the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure of the Basel Convention in granting any permit for the export, import or transit of hazardous wastes. The import, export and transit of hazardous wastes are not allowed with non-Parties to the Basel Convention. The status of ratification of countries to the Basel Convention as well as information on Basel Convention may be viewed at  [http://www.basel.int/](http://www.basel.int/){:target="_blank"}.
