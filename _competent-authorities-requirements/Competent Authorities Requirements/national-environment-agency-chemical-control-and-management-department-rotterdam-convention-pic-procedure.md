# National Environment Agency - Chemical Control and Management Department (Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) Procedure)

On 24 May 2005, Singapore deposited its instruments of ratification and accession with the Secretary-General of the United Nations in New York. The Convention has entered into force for Singapore on 21 Aug 2005 (i.e. the 90th day after the date of deposit of the instruments). The Chemical Control and Management Department (CCMD) of the National Environment Agency (NEA) is Singapore’s Designated National Authority (DNA) under the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure.

With effect from 21 Aug 2005, international trade of hazardous chemicals that are listed under the Convention are subject to the PIC procedure. Under the PIC procedure, countries exporting hazardous chemicals identified in the Convention are only allowed to export to Parties that consent to the import of these PIC chemicals. A customs permit must be obtained through TradeNet before the goods arrive in/depart from Singapore.

1.  Import permit applications for PIC chemicals on the TradeNet  
    All import permit applications containing PIC chemicals will continue to be auto processed. 
  
2.  Export permit applications for PIC chemicals on the TradeNet  
    To avoid unnecessary delays, all export applications shall be made to CCMD at least 2 weeks before submitting the export permit applications through TradeNet. Please ensure that the receiving country has no objection to the import of the PIC chemical. All export permit applications will be routed to CCMD for on-line processing.

Procedures for import/export permit applications for PIC chemicals are similar to that of the other Hazardous Substances controlled by CCMD.
