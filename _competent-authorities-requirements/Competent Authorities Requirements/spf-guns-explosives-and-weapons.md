When importing, exporting or transhipping non-controlled goods which are classified under GEWD’s controlled HS codes, the declarant shall declare the product code as “MISC” for these HS codes.

## On-line processing of Permit Applications

All permit applications containing controlled items under GEWD will be routed to GEWD for online processing. To facilitate the processing of your permit applications, you must ensure that the application is submitted correctly, with all mandatory fields completed and the the required documents uploaded. Incomplete or incorrect applications will be rejected and result in an unnecessary delay.

All permit applications received via TradeNet will be processed in the order in which they are received. GEWD is unable to expedite processing upon request. Declarants are encouraged to submit the permit applications promptly (at least five working days before the intended import, export or transhipment date) to avoid delays in the permit approval.

After submitting the permit application, the declarant shall monitor and track the status of his permit application in TradeNet. If the declarant receives queries from GEWD in TradeNet, he shall respond promptly to GEWD, to avoid delay in the permit approval. Generally, GEWD will process all permit applications within five working days. Please do not contact GEWD to fast track the processing of application or check on the status of application.

For the export of GEW regulated under the GEWCA, a Customs permit with a licence issued under the GEWCA must be obtained through TradeNet before the goods depart Singapore. GEWD will not approve the permit application submitted for any controlled goods that have departed Singapore. Investigation will be carried out against the exporter for all export of GEWD’s controlled goods without prior approval and export licence from GEWD. Violations involving unlicensed activities may result in imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $50,000 for individuals and up to $100,000 for companies.

## Approval Requirements and Conditions

Once the import, export or transhipment permit application is approved, the declarant must forward copies of both the Customs permit and the GEWCA Licence to the importer/exporter. The importer/exporter shall comply with all requirements and conditions stated in these documents. It is the responsibility of the importer/exporter to communicate these requirements and conditions to their cargo handling agent to ensure full compliance.
