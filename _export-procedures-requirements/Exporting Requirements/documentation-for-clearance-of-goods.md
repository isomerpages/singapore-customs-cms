# Documentation for Clearance of Goods

### Documents Required for Containerised Cargo

For containerised cargo, you will need to produce the cargo with the approved Customs export permit and other supporting documents to the checkpoint officers if it is specified in the permit conditions or if the cargo is dutiable or controlled. Please have the permit number at the point of cargo lodgement for verification purposes.

An example of conditions in the permit indicating this requirement:

|  |  |
|--|--|
| A2 | The Goods and this permit with invoices, BL/AWB, etc must be produced for Customs clearance / endorsement at a Free Trade Zone ‘Out’ Gate unless it is directed to the “Green Lane’ at the time of clearance. |
| H1 | The goods and this permit with invoices, BL/AWB, etc must be produced for Customs clearance / endorsement at Woodlands Checkpoint / Tuas Checkpoint. |
| A3 | The goods must be produced with this permit, invoices, BL/AWB, etc for Customs endorsement at an Airport Customs checkpoint or designated Customs office or station as required. |

### Documents Required for Conventional Cargo and Hand-carried Goods

For conventional cargo and hand-carried goods, you will need to produce the cargo with the approved Customs export permit and other supporting documents to the checkpoint officers if it is specified in the permit conditions or if the cargo is dutiable or controlled. Please have the permit number at the point of cargo lodgement for verification purposes.

An example of conditions in the permit indicating this requirement:

|  |  |
|--|--|
| A2 | The goods and this permit with invoices, BL/AWB, etc must be produced for Customs clearance / endorsement at a Free Trade Zone ‘Out’ Gate unless it is directed to the “Green Lane’ at the time of clearance. |
| H1 | The goods and this permit with invoices, BL/AWB, etc must be produced for Customs clearance / endorsement at Woodlands Checkpoint / Tuas Checkpoint. |
| A3 | The goods must be produced with this permit, invoices, BL/AWB, etc for Customs endorsement at an Airport Customs checkpoint or designated Customs office or station as required. |

Please note that partial clearance is not allowed for goods departing Singapore via Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints. You should submit one permit application for each container or vehicle of cargo.

For the export of non-controlled and non-dutiable goods not exceeding S$1,000 in value by air, a Customs export permit is not required.

However, a Customs permit is still required before the export of goods removed from approved licensed premises, or if the goods are controlled, regardless of the value of the goods.

## Hand Carried Export Scheme

Under this [scheme](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Schemes/GST/Hand-Carried-Exports-Scheme--HCES-/){:target="_blank"}, if you are departing from Changi Airport, you must present the goods with the Customs export permit, invoice, boarding pass or confirmed air-ticket to Singapore Customs for inspection.
