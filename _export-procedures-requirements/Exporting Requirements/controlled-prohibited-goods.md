# Controlled & Prohibited Goods

Before exporting your goods, you are required to check if the goods are prohibited for export, or are subject to control before they may be exported.

To check if the goods are controlled, you may [search](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/portlets/search/searchHSCA/searchInitHSCA.do) using the description of the goods, Harmonized System (HS) code or Competent Authority (CA) product code. If the item is subject to control, the name of the CA will be indicated next to its HS code. You may check directly with the respective CAs on their licensing requirements.

If you require advice on the full 8-digit  [HS code](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/portlets/search/searchHSCA/searchInitHSCA.do)  of the product, you may apply for an  [official classification ruling](/files/businesses/SCA004-(2).doc)  at a fee of S$75 per product. Please note our classification rulings are only applicable for use within Singapore.

Please also refer to the goods prohibited for export by the  [United Nations Security Councilâ€™s sanctions](/businesses/united-nations-security-council-sanctions) and goods subject to control under the  [Strategic Goods (Control) Act](/businesses/strategic-goods-control/strategic-goods-control-list).
