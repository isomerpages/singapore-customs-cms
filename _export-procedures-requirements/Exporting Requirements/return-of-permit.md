# Return of Permit 

For goods exported by sea or air, exporters must submit the export permits to the shipping or airline agents within 7 days of export. This is to enable manifest reconciliation by the shipping or airline agents for the submission of the manifest reconciliation statement to Singapore Customs within 14 days of export.
