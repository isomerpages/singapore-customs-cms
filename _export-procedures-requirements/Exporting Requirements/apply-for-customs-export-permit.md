# Obtain Customs Export Permit

To export goods from Singapore, you will need to:

-   Register with the [Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA)](http://www.acra.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"}, or the relevant [Unique Entity Number](http://www.uen.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"} (UEN) issuance agency, to obtain a UEN; and
-   [Activate your Customs Account](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/TN41EFORM/tds/sp/splogin.do?action=init_acct){:target="_blank"}

After activating your Customs Account, you may:

-   Appoint a [declaring agent](/businesses/business-resources/directories-of-service-providers/list-of-local-forwarding-agents) to obtain customs permits on your behalf; or
-   Obtain customs permits for your own shipment or on behalf of your clients. To do so, you need to [register as a declaring agent](/businesses/new-traders-and-registration-services/registration-services/apply-update-renew-terminate-declaring-agent-account-and-declarant) and [apply for a TradeNet user ID](/businesses/national-single-window/overview/what-you-need-to-know-about-tradenet).

All permit applications must be submitted via TradeNet, accessible through:

-   TradeNet front-end solution purchased from any [approved solution provider](/businesses/national-single-window/overview/tradenet-solution-providers), or
-   [Government Front-End Application](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/login.portal){:target="_blank"}.

Please refer to [Permits, Documentation and Other Fees](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/permits-documentation-and-other-fees/) for more information. Declaring agents may charge additional service fees. You may wish to check with your appointed declaring agent on the charges involved.
