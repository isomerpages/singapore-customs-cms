# Permit Exemptions
Certain goods, unless they are dutiable or controlled items, do not require a Customs export permit. These include, but are not limited to:

-   Parcel post
-   Documents
-   Personal or household effects, except motor vehicles, accompanying the passenger (as hand-carried or checked-in luggage) for own use by land, sea or air
-   Trade samples, specimens for analysis or test, and gifts, not exceeding S$400 in total value
-   Goods exported by air (as manifested cargoes or hand-carried goods)  not exceeding S$1,000 in total value.^
-   Locally sourced stores loaded for use on board the vessel (including oil rig) and aircraft

You must obtain permits if the goods are [dutiable](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/duties-and-dutiable-goods/list-of-dutiable-goods) or subject to [control](/businesses/exporting-goods/controlled-and-prohibited-goods-for-export). More information on Hand-carried commercial goods can be found [here](/businesses/exporting-goods/export-procedures/exporting-hand-carried-commercial-goods).

^ *An export permit is required before goods can be exported under the Hand-Carried Exports Scheme (HCES), regardless of the value and quantity of goods.*
