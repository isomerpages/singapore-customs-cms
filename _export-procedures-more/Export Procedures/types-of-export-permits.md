## TradeNet Unavailability

In the event of an unscheduled TradeNet unavailability announced by Singapore Customs, exporters who are unable to obtain an approved permit may be advised by Singapore Customs to use a [Letter of Undertaking](/files/businesses/lou-template-for-tn-unavailability-6aug15-(2).docx) for the clearance of their goods. This will be announced via a Customs notice. The exporter will have to obtain a permit within **three** **days** from the date TradeNet is restored.

For export, transhipment or bringing in transit of strategic goods under Tier 1 of the Strategic Trade Scheme during an unscheduled TradeNet unavailability, exporters will be informed to use a  [Letter of Undertaking for strategic goods](/files/businesses/lou-for-strategic-goods.docx) for clearance of their goods.
