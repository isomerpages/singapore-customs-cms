# Supply of Air/Sea Stores

## Air Stores

Air stores refer to goods supplied for consumption or use on board an aircraft by the crew and passengers outside Singapore. This does not include jet fuel. Examples of air stores include food, water, cleaning supplies, medical supplies, safety supplies and spare parts.

**Customs Permit Requirements for Air Stores and Jet Fuel**

The supply of air stores and jet fuel for consumption or use on board an aircraft does not require a Customs permit. However, a submission of "Monthly Statement for Stores and Jet Fuel Supplied to Aircraft" is required.

**Submission of Statement for Air Stores and Jet Fuel**

Singapore Customs records statistics on air stores and jet fuel for consumption on board an aircraft.

The owner or agent of any aircraft leaving Singapore must submit to Singapore Customs, a monthly statement to declare the total value of air stores and the quantity of jet fuel supplied to the aircraft’s fuel tanks. The statement should be sent to the Permits Compliance Branch via email to [customs_tnreq@customs.gov.sg](mailto:customs_tnreq@customs.gov.sg), by the 15th day of the following month. If there are no aircraft departures or air stores/jet fuel supplied during the month, a nil submission is still required.

## Sea Stores

Sea stores refer to goods supplied for consumption or use on board a vessel by the crew and passengers outside Singapore waters. Examples include food, water, cleaning supplies, medical supplies, safety supplies and spare parts.

Non-dutiable sea stores can be uplifted onto all vessel types.

Dutiable sea stores can only be uplifted to approved types of vessels (passenger vessels, cargo vessels, oil rigs, dredges, fishing vessels, supply boats and tug boats) and are subject to the following ration allowance restrictions:

| Dutiable Good | Ration Allowance per Crew per Day |
|--|--|
|**Cigarettes**  | 40 Sticks|

| **Wine** |0.25 Bottle | 
| **Spirits** | 0.25 Bottle| 
| **Beer or Stout (local or imported)** |4 Cans | 

## Registration as Exporter of Duty and GST-Unpaid Liquor and/or Tobacco Sea Stores

All exporters of duty and GST-unpaid liquor and/or tobacco sea stores are required to be registered with Singapore Customs before an export permit can be obtained via TradeNet. You may register via the [“Application for Registration as an Exporter of Duty and GST-Unpaid Liquor and/or Tobacco Sea Stores”](https://go.gov.sg/exporter-sea-store)  form.

Please refer to [Circular No. 05/2021](/news-and-media/circulars/2021-06-22-Circular052021.pdf) for more information.

## Customs Permit Requirements for Sea Stores

**Duty-unpaid or Suspended and/or GST-unpaid or Suspended Sea Stores**

The uplift of all **duty-unpaid or suspended** and/or **GST-unpaid or suspended** sea stores should be accounted by the following customs permits depending on the movement type:

| Message Type | Declaration Type | Code |
|--|--|--|
| **In-Non-Payment** | **Re-Export**: <br>Re-export of sea stores via the same or different Free Trade Zone (FTZ) [not applicable to goods subject to export control by Competent Authorities (CAs)] | REX |
| **Out** | **Approved Premises / Schemes**: <br> Export of dutiable sea stores from a Licensed Warehouse<br> Export of non-dutiable sea stores released from a Zero-GST warehouse | APS |
| **Transhipment/Movement** | **Inter-gateway Movement**: <br> Movement of sea stores from one FTZ or foreign territory to another FTZ or foreign territory for re-export or storage | IGM |

In addition, **duty-unpaid or suspended** and/or **GST-unpaid or suspended** sea stores that are controlled for export must be supported by proper authorisation (advance notification, licence or certificate approval) from the relevant CAs before they can be uplifted onto the vessels. You are advised to check with the respective CAs on their licensing requirements and to obtain the necessary authorisation before applying for a customs permit.  
  
Please note that ship spares meant for installation onto vessels while the vessels are in Singapore are subject to GST payment and should not be declared as sea stores. You are required to obtain the relevant In-Payment (GST) permits and report your input tax claims directly to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) during the corresponding accounting period. Alternatively, companies under IRAS Major Exporter Scheme (MES) or Import GST Deferment Scheme (IGDS) may obtain the relevant In-Non-Payment permits to import such ship spares meant for installation onto vessels while the vessels are in Singapore.


**Duty and/or GST-Paid or Accounted Sea Stores**

The uplift of **duty** and/or **Goods and Services Tax (GST)-paid or accounted** (i.e. GST-accounted goods refer to those imported under IRAS' Major Exporter Scheme or Import Deferment GST Scheme) sea stores does not require any customs permit, if the goods are not controlled for export. The uplift of such goods must be reported in the "[Monthly Statement of Stores Supplied to Vessels](/eservices/customs-forms-and-service-links)" to be submitted to the Permits Compliance Branch.
