# Exporting Trade Samples

**Trade samples**  refer to goods exported solely for the purpose of being shown or demonstrated overseas. For example, trade samples may be exported:

-   To solicit orders for goods to be supplied abroad; or
-   To a manufacturer for the purposes of copying, testing or experimenting before being produced abroad

## Controlled & Non-Controlled Trade Samples

You are advised to check if your trade sample is a controlled item before exporting it.


|Type of Trade Sample| Export Permit Required? |
|--|--|
|Non-controlled trade samples, including specimens for analysis or test, and gifts, of a total value **not exceeding S$400** <br><br> *Exporters should indicate the goods as “Trade Samples” in the commercial invoice and the Bill of Lading/Air Waybill.  |  No |
| Non-controlled trade samples, including specimens for analysis or test, and gifts, of a total value **exceeding S$400** | Yes |
| Controlled trade samples (regardless of value) | Yes |
