# Exporting Pets

All exports of live pets are regulated by the National Parks Board (NParks)  [Animal and Veterinary Service](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/avs){:target="_blank"} (AVS). You are required to abide by AVSâ€™s  [export licence and pets quarantine requirements](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/avs/pets/bringing-animals-into-singapore-and-exporting/exporting-dogs-and-cats/preparing-to-leave-singapore){:target="_blank"}.

The table below shows the requirements for bringing your personal pet out of Singapore, as well as exporting live pets for commercial purposes, by all modes of transport (land, air or sea).

You may engage a declaring agent who is registered as a TradeNet user to assist with declaring the Customs permits.
