# Permit Validity and Error Messages

## Permit Validity

The validity period of an export permit depends on the type of goods involved, purpose for export, place of release and/or receipt.

Generally, the validity periods for the export permits are as follow:

|**Export Permit (Message Type)**| **Validity Period*** |
|--|--|
| **OUT** |  - Approval date + 9 working days<br><br>  - Approval date + 2 working days if goods are dutiable and released from Customs licensed premises<br><br>  - Approval date + 1 working day for movement of dutiable sea stores |

<sup>*Note: Please refer to the specific validity periods for each permit. If you are unable to utilise the permit within the stipulated period, please [extend the validity period](/businesses/exporting-goods/export-procedures/permit-amendments-and-cancellation) of the permit via TradeNet before it expires

## Error Messages

If a permit application is incomplete or erroneous, you will be prompted with an error code,  **'DCS Error'** generated via TradeNet.

For permit applications that do not meet Singapore Customs’ or other Competent Authorities’ requirements, you will receive a rejection message via TradeNet with the code, **'CA/SC Reject'**.

Please submit a new export application after rectifying the errors or omissions. A new Unique Reference Number (URN) will be provided for the new permit application.
