# Depositing Goods in Free Trade Zones Pending Transhipment
    
   Free Trade Zones (FTZs) in Singapore facilitate entrepot trade and transhipment activities.
    
   You may store goods in the FTZ pending transhipment with duty and/or GST suspended while the goods remain within the FTZ. For cases where goods moving through Singapore do not fall under the various  [transhipment scenarios](/businesses/transhipping-goods/quick-guide-on-transhipping-goods), the goods must be covered by the relevant Customs import and export permits even if they remain within FTZ.
    
   Dutiable liquor and tobacco products may be temporarily stored in the FTZ for a period of  **up to 30 days**, pending transhipment or removal to a licensed premises. If a longer storage period is required, such dutiable goods must be removed from the FTZ to the licensed premises.
    
   Failure to deposit such dutiable goods in the licensed premises is an offence. There is no storage restriction on dutiable goods brought into the FTZ under "through" bill of lading or "through" airway bill. Please refer to  [Circular No. 01/2020](/news-and-media/circulars/circular012020ver1.pdf)  for more information.
