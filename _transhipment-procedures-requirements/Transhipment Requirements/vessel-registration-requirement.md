# Vessel Registration Requirement
    
You are required to **[register vessels of net registered tonnage (NRT)]( https://www.customs.gov.sg/eservices/customs-forms-and-service-links/)** between **75 and 300 (inclusive)** that are intended to be used to carry dutiable Liquors and Tobacco (L&T) products for the purpose of export or transhipment by sea with Singapore Customs. Carrier agents are required to **submit the vessel's Certificate of Registry** issued by the national port/maritime authority of the vessel's flag state via the Government Services (Customs eServices). Upon approval of the vessel registration application, traders may **declare the registered vessel details** in the export permit applications to export dutiable L&T products.
