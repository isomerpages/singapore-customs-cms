# Applying for a Customs Permit
    
   To obtain a Customs permit to tranship goods or transit goods through Singapore, you will need to:
    
   -   Register with the [Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA)](http://www.acra.gov.sg/) or the relevant [Unique Entity Number](http://www.uen.gov.sg/) (UEN) Issuance Agency to obtain a UEN;
   -   [Activate your Customs Account](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/TN41EFORM/tds/sp/splogin.do?action=init_acct).
   
After activating your Customs Account, you may:
    
   -   Register with Customs as a [Declaring agent](/businesses/new-traders-and-registration-services/registration-services/apply-update-renew-terminate-declaring-agent-account-and-declarant);    -   Register with Customs as a Transhipment Agent via the [the Customs Documentation Enquiry Form]( https://go.gov.sg/customs-doc) ; and
   -   Apply for a TradeNet user ID to apply for Customs Transhipment permits (where applicable) for your shipments or on behalf of your clients. Please make sure that you apply for a permit by keying in the correct message and declaration type.
    
All permit applications must be submitted via TradeNet. They are accessible via the TradeNet front-end software from an [approved software vendor](/businesses/national-single-window/overview/tradenet-solution-providers), or the [Government Front-End module](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/login.portal).
