# Controlled & Prohibited Goods

Do take note of the following before transhipping goods through Singapore:

-   Check if the goods you intend to tranship are  [strategic goods](/businesses/strategic-goods-control/overview), [controlled goods, or prohibited goods for transhipment](/businesses/transhipping-goods/controlled-and-prohibited-goods-for-transhipment).

-   The **United Nations Security Council (UNSC)** imposes sanctions that prohibit the importation, exportation, transhipment and transit of certain goods through Singapore to some countries. Please refer to the relevant [UNSC Resolutions](/businesses/united-nations-security-council-sanctions) for more information.

For more information on permit requirements for transhipment or transit of strategic goods, and goods intended or likely to be used in connection with weapons of mass destruction, please click  [here](/businesses/strategic-goods-control/overview).
