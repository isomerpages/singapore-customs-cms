# Documentation for Clearance of Goods

## Documentation for Containerised Cargo

For **cargo**  involving inter-gateway movement, you are required to present the cargo with a printed copy of the approved Customs permit, and other supporting documents to the checkpoint officers at the entry and exit checkpoints for clearance.

Below are some examples of permit conditions indicated in a Customs:

|  |  |
|--|--|
| A1 | The goods and this permit with invoices, BL/AWB, etc must be produced for Customs clearance/ endorsement at a Free Trade Zone "In" Gate. |
| A2 | The goods must be produced together with this permit, invoices, BL/AWB, etc must be produced for Customs clearance / endorsement at a Free Trade Zone ‘Out’ Gate unless it is directed to the “Green Lane’ at the time of clearance. |
| A3 | The goods must be produced with this permit, invoices, BL/AWB, etc for Customs endorsement at an Airport Customs checkpoint or designated Customs office or station as required. |
| H1 | The goods must be produced together with this permit, invoices, BL/AWB, etc for Customs clearance / endorsement at Woodlands Checkpoint / Tuas Checkpoint. |


The container would be affixed with a Customs seal at the entry checkpoint. The sealed container must be produced at the exit checkpoint for clearance within 24 hours after release from the entry checkpoint.

If any discrepancy is detected, such as a tampered Customs seal or the consignment being exported at the exit checkpoint after 24 hours, Customs would conduct investigations and may impose penalties.

For a shipment which requires partial clearance, the same permit should be presented each time for Customs endorsement until the entire shipment has been completely cleared.

Note: Partial clearance is not allowed for goods coming into Singapore via Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints.
