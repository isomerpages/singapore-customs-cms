# For Authorised Agents

Authorised agents have a distributorship agreement signed with the owner of a brand of motor vehicle, which allows them to import and distribute that brand of motor vehicles in certain territories.

If you are a new authorised agent or an existing agent with queries on the import processes and procedures, you may contact us via [Customs_TTSB@customs.gov.sg](mailto:Customs_TTSB@customs.gov.sg).

Existing agents are required to submit Agent's Application for Product Code (SC-A-004) for new models or should there be changes to price, specifications, model code, model year, invoicing currency, incoterm, and assigned supplier of the vehicles they carry.

Please complete this  [form](https://go.gov.sg/agent-pc){:target="_blank"} and submit it with the supporting documents listed in Section E.

Note: 
* If you are importing electric vehicles, including electric motorcycles/ scooters, please email us at Customs_TTSB@customs.gov.sg to enquire about the additional requirements before importing.
* In general, you may expect a reply within 5 working days. For more complex applications, you may expect a reply within 7 working days.
