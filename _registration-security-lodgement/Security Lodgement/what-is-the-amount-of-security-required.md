For first-time security lodgement for permit applications, you are to compute and lodge the amount of security required. The amount of security lodged should be sufficient to meet your operational needs and should include a buffer amount to avoid any possible disruption to your transactions, as a permit application will be rejected if the amount of security required for the permit application exceeds the amount of security lodged with Singapore Customs.

## Operation of Licensed Premises and Other Purposes

For first-time security lodgement for the operation of licensed premises and other purposes, Singapore Customs will inform you the amount of security required to be lodged.
