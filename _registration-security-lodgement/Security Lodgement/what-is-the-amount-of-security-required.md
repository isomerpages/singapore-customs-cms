# What is the Amount of Security Required?

Generally, the amount of security required for a permit application is dependent on the movement type and goods type, as well as the declaring entities' or their appointed declaring agent's banding under the trade Facilitation &amp; Integrated Risk-based System (TradeFIRST) / Declarant Agent Framework. Declaring entities and declaring agents will be accorded different levels of security requirements ranging from a 100% requirement to a waiver of the security requirement depending on their TradeFIRST and DA banding.

For first-time security lodgement for permit applications, you are to compute and lodge the amount of security required. The amount of security lodged should be sufficient to meet your operational needs and should include a buffer amount to avoid any possible disruption to your transactions, as a permit application will be rejected if the amount of security required for the permit application exceeds the amount of security lodged with Singapore Customs.

## Operation of Licensed Premises and Other Purposes

For first-time security lodgement for the operation of licensed premises and other purposes, Singapore Customs will inform you the amount of security required to be lodged.
