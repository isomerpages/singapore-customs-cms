# How to Lodge Guarantee 

You can lodge the security in the form of a Banker’s Guarantee, Finance Company Guarantee or an Insurance Bond.

You are strongly encouraged to apply for the guarantee with any of the participating financial institutions on the eGuarantee@Gov programme. Please refer to [eGuarantee@Gov ](http://www.eguarantee.gov.sg/) for the full list of participating financial institutions.

When you lodge the guarantee via the eGuarantee@Gov programme, you would not need to collect the hardcopy guarantee from the bank and bring it to Singapore Customs. The financial institution will send it electronically to Singapore Customs, saving you time and courier costs.
