<h1>How to Lodge Security</h1>
<p>You can lodge the guarantee in the form of a Banker’s Guarantee, Finance
Company Guarantee or an Insurance Bond.</p>
<p>You are strongly encouraged to apply for the guarantee with any of the
participating financial institutions on the eGuarantee@Gov programme. Please
refer to <a href="http://www.eguarantee.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">eGuarantee@Gov </a>for
the full list of participating financial institutions.</p>
<p>When you lodge the guarantee via the eGuarantee@Gov programme, you would
not need to collect the hardcopy guarantee from the bank and bring it to
Singapore Customs. The financial institution will send it electronically
to Singapore Customs, saving you time and courier costs.</p>
<p>With effect from 1 October 2023, Singapore Customs does not accept hardcopy
guarantees and securities. eGuarantees will be mandatory&nbsp;for all securities
issued to Singapore Customs. You may refer to <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/files/circular 17_2023 (ver 1).pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Circular No: 17/2023</a>

<p>Once the eGuarantee has been received and successfully registered by Singapore
Customs, the primary and secondary contact registered in your entity’s
Customs Account will receive an email notifying that the eGuarantee has
been successfully registered.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the security, Singapore Customs will register the security
within three working days. Upon successful registration, we will send a
notification by email to the primary contact (or the secondary contact
should transmission to your primary contact fails) registered in your
<a href="https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/TN41EFORM/tds/sp/splogin.do?action=init_acct" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Customs Account</a>. Please ensure that the particulars of the primary
contact and secondary contact registered in your Customs Account are updated
for them to receive the notifications.

<p>2) Extension of existing guarantees lodged with Singapore Customs</p>
<p>For eGuarantees: If you had previously applied for an e-Banker’s Guarantee
(eBG) under Singapore Customs’ Electronic Banker’s Guarantee Programme
(BNPP, DBS, HSBC, OCBC and UOB), and wish to extend the validity of your
eBG, you can similarly approach the bank that previously issued the eBG,
to extend it through the eGuarantee@Gov programme. To extend, simply:</p>
<p>1. Quote your existing Bank Guarantee reference
<br>2. Indicate the new expiry date
<br>3. Inform the bank that you wish to extend your guarantee under eGuarantee@Gov
programme, with template reference “CUSTOMS_REG"</p>
<p>Once the eGuarantee has been received and successfully registered by Singapore
Customs, we will send an email notification to the primary and secondary
contact registered in your entity’s Customs Account as per the current
notification process.</p>
<p>NOTE: The procedure above only applies for cases where you are amending
the eGuarantee expiry date only. If you are amending the amount to be lodged,
you will have to apply for a new guarantee.</p>
<p>If you had previously applied for a hardcopy guarantee and wish to extend
the validity, you will have to extend it as a hardcopy guarantee. You will
NOT be able to extend it via the eGuarantee@Gov programme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3) Discharge of guarantees</p>
<p>If you wish to apply for an early discharge of the eGuarantee, you may
submit your request via <a href="https://go.gov.sg/customs-doc" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="new">the Customs Documentation Enquiry Form</a>.</p>
<p>Once we have confirmed that you do not have any outstanding matters with
us, we will inform you of our decision and notify the financial institution
on the discharge of their liability under the guarantee.</p>
