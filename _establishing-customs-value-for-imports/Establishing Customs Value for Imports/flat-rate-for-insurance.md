# Flat Rate for Insurance

Traders may use the flat rate of 1% for insurance to compute the Customs value of imports:

-   For transaction values quoted in *Cost and Freight (CFR) International Commercial Terms (incoterms)*^ and,
-   Where the actual insurance charges are not known or not available to the importer

# No Insurance Purchased
Traders can set the insurance to zero value if no insurance charges were incurred when importing the goods.
