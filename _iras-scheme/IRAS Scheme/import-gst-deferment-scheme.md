# Import GST Deferment Scheme

## What is it?

The Import GST Deferment Scheme (IGDS) is administered by the  [Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS)](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Schemes/GST/Import-GST-Deferment-Scheme--IGDS-/).

This scheme is designed to alleviate the cash flow of taxable traders by deferring the imports’ Goods and Services Tax (GST) payment at the point of import.

## Customs Permit Requirements

Registered IGDS traders must  [obtain](/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/) the relevant Customs import permits via TradeNet for their IGDS shipments.

Please note the following details when obtaining the import permits:

-   **For import of non-dutiable goods with GST under deferment**
    
    -   Message Type = In-Non Payment (INP)
    -   Declaration Type = APS (Approved Premises/Schemes)
    -   Place of Receipt Code = IGDS

-   **For import of dutiable goods with duty payable and GST under deferment**
    
    -   Message Type = In-Payment (IPT)
    -   Declaration Type = DUT (Duty)
    -   Place of Receipt Code = IGDS

-   **For import of dutiable goods with duty exempted and GST under deferment**
    
    -   Message Type = In-Non Payment (INP)
    -   Declaration Type = GTR (GST relief and/or duty exemption)
    -   Place of Receipt Code = relevant exemption codes (for example, TOBSP, EXEMPTD)
