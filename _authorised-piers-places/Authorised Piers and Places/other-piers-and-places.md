In addition, certain cargo may be allowed to be imported/exported via private waterfront locations on a one-time basis, subject to Customs' approval, provided that the following criteria are met:

-   The shipment involves cargo that cannot be handled by the port terminals' infrastructure and/or cannot be transported from the public port terminals to companies' private piers and places due to the road regulations imposed by the Land Transport Authority (LTA). These include bulky, oversized, odd-sized, heavy cargo, or any other special cargo that require unconventional loading methods that cannot be performed by the port operator.
-   The goods to be imported are for the importer's personal use or for use in his own business carried out at such places; and
